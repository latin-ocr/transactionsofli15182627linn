of the Ring-Dove. XVhen the warreners find the young in a
burrow, they fix sticks at the mouth of the hole in such a man-
ner as to prevent the escape of the young⁷ but to allow the old
birds to feed them ; and when they are in good condition they
are taken for the table. This bird is now rarely seen in Suf-
folk; formerly it used to visit that country in prodigious fiocks
during the winter season, feeding on the Buck-wheat stubbles.
Mr. Leathes says that it breeds in old trees near the decoy at
Herringfleet. It lays two eggs, which are nearly oval.

Genus XXXVI. PnAsm NUS.

1. P. Colchicus (Pheasant).

At Campsey Ash, where the Pheasants are well fed with pota-
toes, buck-wheat‚ and barley‚ a cock Pheasant has been killed
which weighed four pounds and a half.

Genus XXXVII. Pmmx.
l. P. rubra (Guernsey Partridge).

These birds are now very plentiful in some parts of Suffolk.
We have seen at least 150 brace in a morning upon Dumning-
worth-heatlu and they are found in greater or less numbers from
Aldborough to Woodbridge. A few are also sometimes seen
in Norfolk. And in moving a straw-stack in the neighbourhood
ot' Harleston last summer, a nest of the Reti-legged Parti-idge
was found upon the top of it, in which were six eggS.

The sportsman finds birds of this kind more difficult to get at

than the Common Partridge, as they run very much before the
clogS.
