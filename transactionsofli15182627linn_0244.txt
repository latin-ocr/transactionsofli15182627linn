“ These birds‚'' as is observed by Mr. Caley‚ ‘⁴ are birds of
passage. They appear in no great numbers, They alight on
the tops of dead trees. The note is loud and harsh.”

This bird has been placed by M. Temminck among the M α-
ίιινι“; but the strength of its formation With respect to its bill,
legs, and tail‚ by no means accords with the characters of those
birds. It belongs more properly to Megalen-us, although not
exactly agreeing with the typical species: its structure being
weaker in comparison with them, as it is stronger with respect
to the Maluri. It seems to indicate a passage between the two
groups. The specimens in the collection were obtained by
ΜΓ. Brown at Broad Sound, near the upper head, October earth,
1802.
