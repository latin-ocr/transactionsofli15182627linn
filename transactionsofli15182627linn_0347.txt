Australicm Bircls in the Collection of the Linnean Sociely. 331

This bird was procured by Mr. Brown on the South coast of
New Holland in 1802.

These two species very closely accord with the Javanese spe-
cies of Pomatorltinus, 1'.711011tamcs, described in these Trans·-
actions. The short and rounded Wings‚ the somewhat length-
ened and rounded tail, and the elevated tarsi, at once point out
the affinity. The bills of the New Holland birds are not so
much arcuated as those of the Javanese; nor is the develope-
ment of the nares so conspicuous. ssut the general accordance
is so great, that we feel no hesitation, in the present imperfect
state of our information at least, in referring all these species to
the same group. The structure of the tongue of these birds, as
well as the nature of their food, is as yet unknown ; and as they
evince in some points a very striking accordance with the
scansorial family of Ccrtlziaslce, we have some doubts whether
they may not be more justly referred to that group than to the
Meliplmgidae. Their mlreS, on the other hand, indicate an affi-
nity to the latter family, where we leave them provisionally for
the present. To whichever of the two groups they will even-
tually be ascertained to belong, they will be found, we make no
doubt, to stand at the extremity of it, and to form the passage to
the other.
