tarum called the plant Crateva Tapia, denoting thereby that he
meant the American plant, continued to quote 1116 §io-vala as
synonymous. Besides this error, both authors fell into one
infinitely worse, by placing the Talna and Mirvala in the same
genus with the Covalam already mentioned ; 1116 former belong-
ing to the order of Cappariclcs, while the latter is one of the
Am‘antiae. The circumstance which seems to have misled Lin-
naeus was, that 1116 Covalam was called Belou by the b’rahnians
of hIalabar, while the· Niirvala is their Rana Belou. then
Linnaeus published the second edition of the Species Plantmwn,
he separated the plant of Jainaica, calling it Crataeva gynamlra:
and W'illdenow (Sp. Pl. ii. 853.) separated the Nih-vala from the
Tapia of Brazil, and joined it to the Crataewz religiosa of Forster
and Υ11111, of which 11 figure 15 given by M. Laniarck (Ill. Gen.
t. 395). Although he is followed in this by M. Poiret (Enc.
Meth. vii. 582), yet I suppose that this 15 an erroneons opinion,
as the berry of the Cratceva religiosa 15 described and represented
as globular‚ and no larger than a small plum, and the leaves as

I have already observed whatan unnatural genus the Crataeva,
115 left by Linnaeus‚ must be considered3 and Dr. Roxburgh
wished to abolish it altogether. Ile therefore not only removed
the species (May-melos) belonging to the order of Aurantice, but
the remaining plant, that he knew, he considered as a mere
Capparis, which he called trifolium (Hert. Beng. 41.). Who-
ever, in fact, endeavours 10 point 0111 1111 65561111111 character
common 10 all the species os C(1J)J)a›·is‚ will find it 11 difficult
matter 10 exclude the Crataeva. Linnaeus seems 10 have at-
tempted it, by removing the Crccfaeva 10 1116 class Doclecandria
from the class Polyanclria, where he at first placed it close by
the Capparis; but this is triffing: one undoubted Capparis has

only nine stamina, and in several Cratcevas the stamina are fully
