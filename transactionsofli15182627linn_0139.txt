marginem cretzcttc'5,fructzc conoide quinquec-apsulari, lanugine leuco-
phaed referto (Alm. 17⁶2. Plzyt. t. 189.f. l.); but this is evidently
an error, the leatlets of the American plant being toothed 011 1116
edges, while in the Indian plant they are quite entire. Rum-
phius and his commentator Burman, as Ι have said, seem
strangely to have considered the Pania and 111οιιί Είαυοιι as the
5111116 plant, but. evidently described only the former. Linnaeus
, (Fl. ΞΨΖ. ι221.) united a plant of America with the ssloul Elavoeffi
but he does not quote Plukenet ; 1111(1 therefore his plant, which
was then common in the gardens of Europe, might have the
edges of the leaflets entire. This plant of Linnaeus in the first
edition of the Species Plantarum became Bomlmr Ceiha (Burm.
Fl. Incl. 145). In the second edition, however, the llsoal Ela—
τοι( having been found different from the American Ceiba de-
scribed by Bauhin and 81011116, 11 was called Bonzbcm· lteptaplzyl-
lum, and new synonyma were given. Among these was still an
American plant described by J acquin; and the Gossgspium 5.

which, although said to be an Asiatic plant, cannot well, on
account of its stamina, be considered as representing the Moal
Elavou. Ι suspect, however, that Plukenet was mistaken con-
cerning the country from which he obtained his plant, for I have
seen none such in India ; and his figure is quoted by all for the tree
of the West Indies. Resides, as Cavanilles observes (Eue. flletlz.
ii. 553.), Linnaeus describes the plant as having a monopetalous
corolla, while that of the Moul Elavozc has five petals; and it is
therefore probable that the plants are different. W illdenow,
although 116 quotes the Hortus Malalmricus, probably meant
some other plant, as he calls it an American 2 and 111 1116 figure
of Plukenet, which he also quotes, there is no appearance of

prickles in even the branch. Further, as in the Hortus· Kete-
