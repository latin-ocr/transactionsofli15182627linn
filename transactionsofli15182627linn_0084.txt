72 Mr. W. S. MACLEAY on the Structnre of the Tarsus

far as I have been able to observe, is a very accurate description
of all those sand insects which are allied to Pinzelia and Tenebrio.
The manner, however, in which a Helops is heteromerous may
perhaps be explained by examining the posterior pentamerous
tarsus of Erotgslzts; in which case we should say that it is the
penultimate joint of the tarsus that is evanescent in the Helo-
pidce. In the heteromerous Cisteleme of M. Latreille we have a
genus sslycterus, evidently allied to the Curculioniclae3 and a very
careful dissection has made it appear to nie that it is in reality
pentainerous, only the third and fourth joints of the posterior tarsi
are nearly confluent. Hence, in heteromerous insects generally,
we may perhaps suppose that it is the. fourth joint of the tarsus
which vanishes. I say generally, because there may be many ex-
ceptions to the rule; perhaps, for instance, Meloe and the insects
allied to it. These are true Meter-omero,- buton looking at their
posterior feet we find an obconical process, which seems to re-
present the lost articulation, and occasions one almost to fancy,
although not perhaps very philosophically, that it is the second
joint of the tarsus which articulates with the tibia. The Linnean
genus Cassicla and Alarnus appear to have only four joints to their
tarsus, which differs lnoreover fron] that of the Clirgssomelidce, in-
asmuch as all these four articulations are dilated. The affinity of
cassida to Chrysomela shows us here also which joint is evanes-
cent 3 and we find, in fact, that the last joint, although dilated at
the extreniity, puts on the appearance of the piece formed by the
two last articulations of the tarsus in Clzrysomela. This circum-
stance may serve to throw light on the structure of the foot in
Eumorplzus‚ and the other insects commonly but erroneously
called trimerous. I have shown them to be at least tetramerous :
and Ι conceive, froin analogy, that it is the penultimate joint
that is here also evanescent. But however this may be, enough
has been said to prove the worthlessness of the tarsal system,
