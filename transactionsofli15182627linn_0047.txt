2. P. cinerea (Partridge).

The Partridges at Blakenham in Suffolk‚ where the soil is
chalky‚ are said to be of a lighter colour than they usually are
seen upon other soils. We know not whether the same remark
has been made upon those which inhabit the other chalky dis-
tricts of the kingdom. Temminck, in his Natural History qs
Pigeons and Gallinaceous Bit-ds, observes, that the Common Par-
tridge, as well as other birds, is subject to vary both in 51Ζο and
colour from local causes, particularly from the abundance or
want of food. W e have seen a brace of White Partridges, which
were killed last year at Kittleburg in Suffolk : through the
white, the inarkings of the feathers, on olose inspection, faintly
appear.

The bills of young Partridges are dusky at the base, with horn-
coloured tips. Those of the old ones are of a pale lead colour.
The legs of the young birds have a yellow tinge, which 111 1110

3. Ρ. Οοίιινηιῖτ (Quail).

This species used formerly to be very common in the neigh-
bourhood of Diss. It is now become scarce, but still occasion-
ally breeds in that part of the country: and not long since two
Quails’ nests were found by some workmen mowing clover. In
one of them there were seventeen eggs ; in the other, twelve. 11Ῑο
have also received its 0885 from the neighbourhood of Hunstan-
ton in Norfolk. These birds are also become scarce in those
parts of Suffolk where they formerly abounded.

Genus XXXVIII. Oris.
