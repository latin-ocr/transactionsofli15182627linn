of the trees) should be supposed to indicate them to be plants
indigenous to Malabar. Pera was probably corrupted into Pela,
because these trees had av considerable resemblance to that
which will be next described.

Plukenet (Alm. 181.)justly considers both the plants of Rheede
as mere varieties of one species differing in the colour and size
of the fruit, a distinction that was adopted by Dr. Roxburgh:
but Rheede and Linnaeus seem rather to have founded the dis-
tinction on the shape of the fruit, and erroneously held them to
be distinct species. I may however refer to my Commentary
on the first volume of the Ilm-barium Amboinense (p. 140.) for
what further Ι have to say conccrning these plants.

The natives of Malabar call this also Karou Pela,- and in fact
it has a considerable resemblance to the Psallam, as Rheede
and his commentator observe, although it is more nearly allied
to the Qud division of Jussieu's illast—ti, especially to the Pirigara
or Gustavia ,· for according to Goertner (De Sem. ii. ¹264.) it is
not yet ascertained that the Pirigarcz wants the albumen. This
organ the Peloza decidedly has; and on this account it may be
doubted if it might not rather be classed with the end division
of Jussieu's Guaiacame, although its petala are quite distinct.

Although one of the most common and generally diffused
trees in India, no notice, so far as I know, was taken of it by
European botanists until 1800, when Iwent to Mysore ; and on
my return 111 1801 showed it to Dr. Roxburgh, who in the fol-
lowing year procured plants from Colonel Ilardwicke (Hort.
Beng. 52), and described it under the 11111116 of Careya arborea,
calling it after the missionary of that name, most justly entitled
to the honour by his diligence and knowledge of botany, al-
though Ι 1111(1 previously called it Cumbia, and under this name
