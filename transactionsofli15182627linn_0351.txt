the Ionian Islancls. By Robert Kaye Greville, LL.L). F.L.S.

Reacl February 7, 1826.

UNDER the impression that the smallest contribution towards a
more complete knowledge of the botany of the Grecian Isles
would not be unacceptable to the Society, I have drawn up the
following brief account of a collection of cryptogamic plantis
recently brought from thence by the Right Honourable the Earl
of Guilford. It was placed in my hands by Mr. David Don,
Librarian to the Society.

The number of species contained in the collection is but
small: and it is necessary to observe, that many of the spe-
cimens are in too imperfect a state to admit of minute exa—
mination; these Ι have omitted, preferring to give a shorter
list than run the hazard of adding to the number of the errors
with which cryptoganiic botany is already so much incumbered.
There are still, however, several plants of great interest, and some
new species.
