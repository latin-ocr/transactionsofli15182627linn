464 Dr. Sili'rss's Dcscription qs two Quadrapeds

partial intermixture of a 11111οκ 01 blackish-brown sort. A dirty
tawny-white, or rather tawny-gray, occurs also on the back and
sides, but is 111 111050 places less distinctly observed in conse-
quence of the number of large irregular blackish spots, or trans-
verse oblique stripes, which in some specimens are of so great a
size and so closely set that their colour may be considered as the
ground one, and the lighter 111105 only as variegations. The root
of the 11111 15 11 111111· tawny, and the tip, or indeed the greater
part of its length, bushy and black, with a slight intermixture of
white hairs, 111111 1110 whole measuring about eight 11101105 111
length. Outsides of 1110 legs dirty-white crossed by a number
of narrow nearly straight deep black bands, which are regularly
wanting on the insides. Feet dirty-white and without variega-
tions, each with four toes, and each 100 with a short strong
claw.

From 1111 early age, the great length of the hair formed a
very striking feature 111 1110 appearance of the captive speci-
men; yet 1 nevertheless felt inclined to view it 115 1111 example
of the common striped 51100105, and was disposed to attribute
for a time the length of the covering to the circumstance of the
aniinal’s confinement. Recent examinations, however, of seve-
ral others of a similar description, all of which had passed their
early, and some of their mature, years in a state of nature, have
proved, that the peculiarity alluded to did not depend upon the
change of situation, but was common to it under all circum-
stances, and therefore with other characters has led me to regard
it as a distinct species-⁴¹³.

In its manners, habits, and disposition, it agrees with the
spotted 5011; but from an inferiority of physica] powers it is a

³* l 111110 110 means of ascertaining the ILJ'usra of Geoffroy St. Hilaire: at any

rate the description of that species does not correspond with ours-
