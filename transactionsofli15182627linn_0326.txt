:310 Mr.v100ns’s anclDr.I⁷101zS1211zLD’s Description of tlte

the Troclzilidce. The former members are short and rounded,
the four first quill—feathers gradually exceeding each other in
length, and those which succeed by degi-ees decreasing. The
tail also in the typical species of the family is long and gra-
duated. On the other hand, the tarsi and feet are endowed
with much strength, and the powers of the hind-toe in parti-
cular are 6011511161101151)7 developed. We have already observed
the great deficiency of true climbing birds which prevails in
New Holland ; and this peculiarity of the strong scansoria] leal-
lmr may enable the Jlseliplzagzssclae in some measure to supply
that deficiency. The prevalence 11150 of 11115 character, which
they hold in common with the nei ghbouring family of Certlziasloe,
with which they are also united by the character of the extensile
tongue, points out the continuance of the chain of 111111111165
which connects the neighbouring Tribes of Scansores and Tc-
*aniz-osnes together; and adds another to the numberless in-
stances of the harmonious disposition of nature.

Besides the characters which thus indicate that the Maipha-
gicloe are placed at the cxtremity of 1116 'l'ribe of Tenuit-ostres‚
there are 0116 01· two particulars which separate them from the
inore typical Iloriegsssfi’cslitzg· groups. Their tongue 15 divided
at the apen: into several filaments ; while that of the Trochilidae is
bifid only at the end. We have not at present sufficient datu to
determine the general character of the tongues of the other
Tenum-ostra families, and shall therefore make no comparison
with them on a point on which we could speak only partially.
One more character must be observed as peculial· to 0111 New
Holland ἔνι-0111). The nares, which in all the other samilies of
the tribe are situated at the base, and are more or 1655 rounded,
are here longitudinal and linear, forming a lengthened 5111
extending in some instances nearly to half the length of the bill,
and partially closed above by a longitudinal membrane. This
character prcvails 50 far in the family as to be almost the only

external
