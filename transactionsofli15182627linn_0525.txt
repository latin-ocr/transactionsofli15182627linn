of (ιη Orang Otang. 473

which covers the palms and the inside of the fingers is strongly
furrowed by those parallel and spiral lines, which in our own
hands, those of the apes generally, and in many of 1116 Plauti-
grada, announce the acuteness of the sense of touch. The skin
is of a reddish-brown colour; and the nails, which are about
an inch in length, are dai-ker. The thumb, as in all these
creatures, is comparatively short, but extremely powerful; and,
as before observed, placed nearly at right angles with the meta-
tarsal bones.

These gigantic specimens having thus all the characters which
pertain to the hindei· hands of the true Simia Satyrus of Linnaeus,
or the l‘xed Orang Otang of the Eastern Islands, of which very
young individuals have occasionally been brought to Europe,
it becomes a question, whether we are to refer them to that
speciem whether we should regard them as belonging to a spe-
cies very similar, yet distinct from that animal, as the Pongo,
described by Worms, has been thought to be; or whether we
should consider these two animals, the Simia Satyrus and the
Pongo, to be the same species of different ages, as they have been
supposed to be by Cuvier, Desmarest, and others, who regard
1116 Pongo as the adult animal. Now, certain it is that they very
closely resemble each other in many of their characters ; and I
should be strongly inclined to acquiesce 111 11115 latter supposi—
tion of their identity, could difficulties be overcome which have
arisen from an examination of several skeletons of Orang Otangs‚
for opportunities of doing which, I am especially indebted to
Mr. Clift and Mr. Brookes.

Among these difficulties, the most important arises from a
difference in the number of the vertebrae ; for in the perfect
skeleton of the Pongo at the Royal College of Sui·geonS‚ I find
five lumbar vertebrae instead of four, which latter is the number

in all the specimens of S. Satyrus that have fallen under my
3 Ρ ⁶2 observation.
