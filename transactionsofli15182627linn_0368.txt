the form of its corolla, essentially distinguish it from both these
genera. Both ellani-mulia and Antirrlzinmn have their seeds
covered by a thick spongy testa, which is very much wrinkled,
and resembles in a remarkable degree the testa of the curionis
cruciferous genus ParrJsa of M r. Brown. 'l'his character is also
niet with in all those genera which are intimately allicd to Λη-
κίιϊΙιὶηιωης and it appears to me to be of sufficient importance
to warrant their being regarded as a separate section, which may
be denominated Antii-rhime& (melone, on account of its tlat
seeds and foliaceous cotyledons, will constitute another section
of the order, forming the link os affinity between it and Bignoni-
acea», froin which it principally differs in the direction of its
seeds, and in the presence of albumen. Scsamnm corresponds
with the latter family in the absence of albumen; but in the
form and direction of its seeds it is· closely allied to Chelone,
from which it is however essentially distinguished in the struc-
ture of its eapsule, the absence of albumen, and by having the
cells of its anthers parallel. It may therefore be considered as
forming, together with lllartynia and Crunffllariu, a distinct na-
tural group, as has already been suggested by Mr. Brown.

In Sei-ophtalmia the upper lip of the corolla is so much more
developed than the lower one as to give the tlower the appear-
ance of being resupinate. The anthers of this genus ditl'er very
materially in structure from those of every other genus of the
order: they are unilocular‚ and open by means of a transverse
tissare, and the cell is attached along its whole length to the
summit of the filament, in which particular it recedes from the
usual form of the one-lobed anther.

A number of other sections equally distinct might be indi-
cated, the adoption of which would greatly facilitate a know-
ledge of the genera of this extensive order. In a practieal
point of view, the advantages arising from the division of
