enabled the moderas to arrive at conclusions with much more
expedition than they, and with equal safety. It does that at
once which is constantly 801118 011 111 ordinary languz‘rgQ—-the
modifications of it to express the classes of external objects. The
invention of new terms suited to express new ideas in an abridged
and compressed form, is a slow process, and in most cases is the
result of convenience. There is no convention to attain the
object, because nobody can arrest the subtile means that are
employed. But the naturalist being without terms, or at most
with so few that they are within his power, attempts to anticipate
the slow process usually working in language, and forms at once
his instruments of reasoningg and systems and methods can be
regarded as 110 further useful, than as they are assimilated to the
ordinary process of abridging the labour of thought adopted by
mankind in other subjects of a like nature.

Naturalists err greatly who imagine they are employing terms
possessing some new and distinct properties; whereas all they
can do is to hold the subjects of natural history 10861116111111 10056
manner by the use of the words species, genus, order, and class:
thus presenting certain characters to the mind as separate objects
of contemplation by means of abstract terms, of a similar though
somewhat 111016 precise impert than those which are employed by
the rest of mankind in treating general subjects. A 51116161· 1156
may be made of these words by naturalists than by metaphy-
516111115, because the business of the 0116 15 10 examine characters
and qualities more nicely than the subjects entertained by the
other will admit of. Nevertheless, the 0116 cannot employ these
abstractions as instruments of reasoning in a different sense from
the other. There 15 110 11111816 about them in the hands of a
naturalist more than there is in any of the thousand general ternis
in the mouths of the vulgar. ²‘ Rose³¹ and ‘⁴ Grass⁵³ were 86116116
