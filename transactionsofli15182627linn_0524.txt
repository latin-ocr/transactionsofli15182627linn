Captain Anderson, to obtain further information on the subject,
a great many other curiosities were shown to 1116, 101 which he
had been indebted to the munificence of the same chief—It
now then becomes necessary to point out more especially what
I conceive to be 1111 peculial· claims 01 111656 specimens to our
attention.

tion in which they have been preserved, they are, in 1116 first

Dr. Abel in his highly interesting account 01 1116 gigantic Orang
Otang, killed at Raniboom in Sumatra, which he computes to
have measured 7 feet 6 11161165 111 height, states it to have had

cimens extend no less than 15 11161165 and a quarter. Notwith-

The second circumstance worthy of notice is the fact that
