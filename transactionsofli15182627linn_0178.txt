„164 RIajor-General HA RDWICKE'S Description

the projecting points of the posterior grinders. This character.
as far as our observation extends, is peculiar; it does not exist,
except in a small degree, in any other genus of carnivorous
quadrupeds. The truncation, carefully described in the generic-
character, is owing, in our opinion, to original structure, and is
not produced by the wearing down of the points. We observe
it both in the skull of a young animal and in that of the adult
specimen, from which the annexed drawing was made ; and our
description is confirmed by a careful comparison of the relative
elevation of the points of the two anterior grinders, in which,
although they are equally exposed to attrition, this truncation is
not observed. The margins bounding the truncated points, as
is shown in the drawing, are circumscribed and perfect, exhibit-
ing no signs of being worn down by attrition. In the disposi—
tion and even in the form of the teeth, our animal bears some
resemblance to the genera Nasna and Procyon ,· but these differ
essentially in the lengthened form of the head, and in the ex-
tended rostrum, which is terminated by a flexible rhinarium:
they also differ in the number, character, and distribution of the
grinders. Nasam and Procyon have in both jaws six grinders, of
which the three anterior are false grinders ; and of those which
follow, none of the points, even in the adult state, exhibit the
truncation above described 111 the generic character. Our ani-
mal has only one false grinder, with a compound crown, and the
four posterior grinders are large and highly complicated: the
first of these in the upper jaw corresponds with the fourth
grinder in Nasam and Procyon, and the points are attenuated
and acute3 but the posterior grinders are quite peculial· and
characteristic in their structure.

Its haunts are about rivers and mountain·torrents. It lives
much in trees, and feeds on birds and the smaller quadru-
peds. lt is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resem-
