sequently, thatin accordance with this structure, its movements
are by far more active than those of any other Land Tortoise I
have seen ; and that although the feet retain the clavated form
belonging to the Testucliniclae, yet this is so much modified as to
show a marked approach to the flattened, palmated conformation
of those of the Emyclidce, whilst the claws are observed to assume
somewhat of the length and sharpness which characterize the
Freshwater family. These evident affinities to the latter group
are remarkably strengthened by a peculiarity of structure in the
(lorsam or upper bony shell, which is divided into two portions,
the posterior of which is moveable‚ and capable of being brought
into actual contact with the posterior margin of the sternum, so
as completely to protect the hindei· feet and tail when they are
withdrawn within the shell ; or, by relaxing the muscles which
had thus closed the box, to allow of its being opened to the ex-
tent of from one-half to three-fourths of an inch. This singular
capability of motion is produced by the absence of any bony
union between the fifth and sixth ribs, which are only connected
by means of an elastic ligamentous substance. I have since
become possessed of several shells of this speeies, in all the older
specimens of which, that part of the inferior margin of the upper
shell which is opposed to the edge of the sternum, is actually
eroded by the force with which it has been continually brought
into contact with it.

Although the situation of the hinge I have describech and the
part to which the office is assigned of closing the shell, are dif-
ferent in the two groups, there is still, in the fact of a peculial*
structure being formed for this specific purpose, a relation be-
tween them, which, conjointly with the other affinities of con-
formation to which I have alluded‚ appear to me to justisy the
view I have taken of them, as forming the two links by which the

families are connected.
