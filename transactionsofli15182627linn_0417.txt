and but two in the Golden Eye. The ribs of the birds of this
division are elongated; the keel of the breast-bone gradually
decreases in depth; the position of the wings is more forward,
the legs placed further back. The tracheae of these Ducks
are particularly distinguished from those of the others by the
enlargement at the bottom of the tube being covered with a
delicate membrane, supported by slender portions of bone ; the
trachea of the Red-crested Duck (Tan. XV. e.) is an example
of this form, and may be considered the type of this divi-
sion. As the Egyptian Goose has in this arrangement been
considered the link between the Geese and the tirst division
of the true Ducks, from its possessiug, with the characters
of the former, the bony enlargement of the trachea coni-
mon to the latter: and the Velvet Duck‚ for similar reasons,
supplying the link between the two divisions of true Ducks.

appears to complete the arrangement, by exhibiting some of
the characters found in the Mergansers, which are next in suc—
