IN a monograph of the ‘⁶ Freshwater Tortoises having a move-

Journal, Ι took occasion to remark, that it is in the genus Terra-
pene‚ and especially in those species which had been confounded
by authors under the trivial name clausa, that we must look for
the intermediate affinities by which the Freshwater Tortoises are
connected with those which inhabit the land. These relations,
however, are such as to constitute them a group of the family
Emycliclse or true Freshwater Tortoises, notwithstanding their
habits and structure approach in a certain degree to those of
the Testudinislae or Land Tortoises : and I sought in vain amongst
the known species of the latter family for the slightest approach

to such a similarity of structure as should point out a relation to
the former.

About two years since, however, Ι obtained a living specimen
of a new species of Tortoise (Kinixys castanea of the present
connnunication), which appeared to possess in several particu-
lars the relations of which I was in search. In the depressed
form and remarkable lateral expansion of the shell‚ it exhibits
an evident approach to the form of the shell in the genus Emys,
whilst the size of the openings for the passage of the feet indi-
