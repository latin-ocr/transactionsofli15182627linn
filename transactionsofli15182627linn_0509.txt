upon their lines, measured {jeth of an incl] between the extreme
points of the head and abdomen; &th of an 111011 1101055 the

The second species has also four eyes of a greater magnitude
than the other four. 'l‘he arrangement and relative 51Ζο of three
pair placed in the fore-part of the head may be thus expressed
by dots ⁶...t 3 one of the other pair of large eyes being situated
on each side of the head. Spiders of this species have 1110 11151

11111 rarely in 11 111101111 (1110011011. They vary considerably in
colour, some being of a 11111011 darker hue 1111111 0111015, and these
are frequently without the pale longitudinal line which extends
the whole length of the thorax, and sometimes even on to the
abdomen of the lighter-coloured 5110011110115. The largest indi-
viduals seen floating in the air were somewhat inferior in weight
and dimensions to the largest of the preceding 51100105 observed
under similar circumstances?
