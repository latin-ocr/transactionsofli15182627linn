132 Dr. Famem llimnmox's Commentary

TsJEJmU Mena ALLoe seu A1100,p.71.tah.56.

Rheede describes two species called „Ueer Alone,- this, and the
litte illem-Alea mentioned in page75: and the two 111111115 are very
nearly allied, both belonging to the natural division of 1116 genus
Ficus, which 11115 pedunculated fruit: a circumstance generally
connected with scabrous or very rigid leaves, having their sides
either unequal or lobed or indented, while the species with sessile
fruit have soft, entire, and equal-sided leaves. The resemblance
between the two Meer A lons is striking not only to the vulgar of
Malabar, but to the Brahnians, wh'o give them both the generic
appellation of Parni. The 'I'sjcrozc Meet· A lou is the prototype of
the genus Parni, having no specitic name prefixed. It is quoted
with doubt in W'illdenow (Sp. Pl. iv. 1145.) for the I³icustc1=ebrata;
but as this has sessile fruit, we may safely reject the quotation,
this circumstance, as I have said, being of the most essential
importance 111 distinguishing the species of this genus. I at
one time thought that it might be the plant of Rumphius figured
in the 85111 1111116 of the third volume, which in the explanation
of the plate is called Varinga ruht-cm and this led me to suppose
that it was the 8qu 01· Varinga rubens.- but I observe that this
is an error, and that Rumphius describes 110 plant called faringa
rubra, while the 86111 1111116 represents 1116 Sapo, 11 large tree.
But plate 85 therefore represents no doubt the I'aringa repens,
a climber, which consequently cannot be the Tsjeroza *Meet-Alete.
1 think it probable that the same erroneous explanation of the
85111 1111116 16(1 M. Lamarck (Enc. Metlz. ii. 497.) 10 quote it,
although with doubt, for his Ficu.5py7·{sbli(c (not that of Burman,
Fl. Incl. 2¹26), which therefore may be very nearly allied to the
Tfjeroa Meet· Alme, although M. Poiret quotes this, 111 imitation
Of Willdenow‚ for Ficus terebrata (Enc. Melle. Sap. ii. 645). I
