him that the bird was only seen in summer, that 116 knew nothing
of its nest, but that it sed upon figs at 1116 Flats. These birds
had also been pointed out by the natives to Mr. (311161Υ 111 their
flight; at which time he observed them very high in 1116 1111, 1111(1

the present individual had two large caterpillars and some of the
gold heetles (Anoplogmttlms viridi-cenem, &c.‚ Leach) in its 510-

The chief groups which composc the tenuirostral Tribe of the
Insessores, 01· 111111 assemblage of birds which derive their 11111111
nourishment from the suctorial powers of their tongue, are
distinguished not only by their geographical distribution, but
by striking peculiarities which point out their greater or less
accordance with the typical characters of the Tribe. The most
prominent indication of typica] pre-eminence among 1116111 15
exhibited in the superior developement of those organs or
powers which contribute to the purposes of feeding by suction
on the wing, and the consequent deticiency of those members
which are suited for functions of 11 different nature. And in
determining the different 5111110115 01 1116 various groups of the
Tribe, we are thus guided to the central or typical assemblage
by detecting the superior powers of ssight exhibited in the wings
and 11111, and the accompanying weakness of 1116 bill and legs.
