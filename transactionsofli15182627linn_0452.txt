these researches, and bred with great difficulty one imperfect
specimen of the true Gu'strus Bovis. Linnmus next followed;
but not having ever seen the insect, and not daring to describe
from figures merely, or the descriptions of others, 110 took the
large llorse l'jot for it‚-—thc (Es-trus Equi of my enuineration.
'i'his error is continued through all the editions of the Sys-teum
Natio-(e, intending all the while, and referring to Vallisneri and
Reaumur for, the true (Estrns Bovis. Thus, like some of the
11110101115, 110 also described a spotted-wingcd 1115001, for the OEstrns
Boe& whereas the true insect lias perfectly spotless wings. The
true fly cannot be caught in the act of oviposition, from the
violent running of the cattle, and the terror they are in at the
approach of their enemy.

'i' his makes it more than probable, nay, almost certain, that

wings, or with a trunk or proboscis, &c., they knew nothing
about the true (Ε. Bovis, and had been deceivcd as to the real
object of their rescarch. It was indeed much more easy for
them to have been presented with one of 1110 numerous 11051 of

impossible they should have discovered, or been made acquainted
with, the true object of such disturbance. Indeed, during these
commotions it would be dangerous to approach the cattle, or

under any other circumstance, how could it be known that it was
