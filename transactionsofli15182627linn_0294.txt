278 Mr.V1G0ns's andDr. HonsFIELD’s Description oftlze

But they are not equally well adapted to the ground as the spe-
cies of Platgscerc113‚ not having an equal length of tarsus, or the
same shortncss and roundness of wing. The gradual approach,
however, of the two genera, both in characters and habits, is
singularly conspicuous.

ΜΓ. Caley says of this species‚—“ The native name I have
forgotten. The scttlers call it Ground Par-rot. lt feeds upon
1110 ground. Great carc is required in taking off the skin, from
its being particularly fine and thiu, and readily torn. The crop is
generally full of small grass—secds; and should it be cut or torn,
so as to lot these seeds out among the fcathers, it is with dif-
ficulty they are got off again, from their having become glu-
tinous in the stomach. The nativos tell me it chiefly breeds in
a stump of a small ll'lzite &zm-trec, making no other nest than
of the dccayed parts of 1110 trce. It, has eight young ones. The
eggs are white without spots.”

Mr. Caley informs us that this bird is called by the settlers
Hohart Ground Pari-ot. The nativo namo he has not ascertained.
Our male specimen was brought by that gentleman from Van
Diemen’s Lansl; the female was procured by Mr. Brown at King
George's Sound.
