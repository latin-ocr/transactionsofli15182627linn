οη the Hortus Malabaricus, Part III. 83

sylvestris Malaba2·2'ca‚ folio acuto, fructu Prmzifacie. The spe-
cific name Kalon implies sylvestris; and Inde( is evidently the
sanie name with Indi, which, according to Plukenet (A lm. (277),
the natives of Ceylon give to the Date—palm. Palma sylvestris
is therefore a translation of Katou Imlel. The Plumae dactyli-
ιἵει-(1, which was the Palma first known to the learned of Europe,
according to Plukenet is distinguished by the Ceylonese specific
name Malea (great) prefixed to Imm,- while he mentions another
kind, called by the Ceylonese Hm Indi, which he describes as
Palma ‹lactyl{j'er·a minor humilis, sylvestri& fructu minore. (Alm.
277.) This he considers as different from the Κηίου Inde& but
the elder Burman (Thes. Zegd. 183.) considered them as the same.
Ι should have no doubt that Burman was in the right, were there
not another species of thesa me genus (Plzcrnia·fiwimjbra, Hort.
Beng. 73.) to which the term humilis is 111016 applicable ; for the
Καίοιι Indel is fully as large as the Plzoenix clactylifera. Neither
Plukenet nor Burman, however, says any thing specitic concern-
ing the size of the Hm Ι)ι(]ιῗ; only the term humilis applied to it,
is used also by Plukenet for the dwarf Palm of Spain (Cham-
rops humilis), which is of a similar size with the Plzoenirfarimfera,
and does not approach near in magnitude to the Katozc Inclel.
I therefore refer the Hin. Indi to the Plzaenhrflzriniferu, which is
a very common plant on all the hilly country between the Ganges
and Cape Comorin. I have, however, great doubts of the Malia
Indi of Ceylon being the proper Date of Arabia, or of its being
different from the Katon Inslel, which I know is very common in
Ceylon3 but I never heard of proper Dates being produced
either there or in any part of India. It is true that in the
gardens of the curious I have seen a few trees imported from
Arabia; but I never saw these produce fruit. It is also true
that I consider the Katoa Indel as merely the wild plant of the
same species with that which is cultivated in Arabia and Africa z
