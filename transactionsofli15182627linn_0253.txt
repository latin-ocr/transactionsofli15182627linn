The specimens of this bird in the Society’s collection are in
very bad condition ε but from their general characters, and the
accounts we have received of their manners, we consider them
as sufficiently according with M. Bechstein's group of Scaricola.
Mr. Caley in his Notes thus observes of these birds.—-“ Cataract
Bit-cl.- an inhabitant of rocky ground—While at the Waterfall
of Carrunggurring, about thirty miles to the southward of
Prospect Hill‚ I saw several of them. I have also seen them in
the North Rocks‚ about a couple of miles from Paramatta: and
always upon the rocks. I never observed them in trees or
bushes.'’ A specimen in the collection presented by Mr. Brown
is marked as found by that gentleman at Port J ackson, Septem-
ber 15th‚ 1803.

We have some doubt as to this species according exactly with
Mr. Lewin’s sssotacilla solitaria, and have therefore added a
more detailed description of it than is our custom when noticing
a published specieS.
