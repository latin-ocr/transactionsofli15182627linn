mode, which was to place this residue at the end. Linnaeus too
was very correct when he pronounced his natural orders to be a
⁴⁶ Fragment ;” and those persons who imagine it to be necessary
or advantageous to find a place for every thing, and to divide and
split for the purpose of making such places, appear to lose sight
of the chief object of the natural system, and to destroy its utility
as an instrument of general reasoning.

The French writers in general are prone to combine in their
systems the very distinct objects of individualizing and genera-
lizing. They are for ever subdividing where the great aim
should be to combine, and thus they detract from the utility of
their arrangements for either purpose. It is they who have
countenanced the use of suh-classes, colem-ts, tribes, stirpes, sub-
gcnera, and sub-specics ; and they also are the great contribu-
tors to the minute division of genera. Strictly speaking, in the
natural system we should employ but few terms of the kind al-
luded to, and those of loose application. For instance, the word
sort or group would as correctly express any natural assemblage
of species, as snb-class, racc, tribe, coleort, or stirps; for what
do we know of the relative value of the groups attempted to be
pointed out by these expressions? And how can we say they are
not co-ordinate or commensurate with each other? The great
division of cotyledonous plants may, for aught we know, be only
equivalent to the order of Crasses; and a genus in some cases
seems as distinct as any class, as Parnassia and Limusa among
plants, and the Ornitlzorhynclms and Hippopotami&amonganimals.
Indeed in the recent work of M. Latreille, “ Familles Natat-elles
(Ιιι Εἰς-ηε Animal,” he has arranged the monotrematous animals
in a class by themselves, and has made two orders3 in one case,
consisting of a single species, the Ornitlzorltynclms paradooens, and
in the other, of two other species before considered as belonging
to that genus. Thus it is, as Μ. Cuvier remarks, that these ani-
