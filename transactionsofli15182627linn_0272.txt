There is no group which requires more revision than the
extensive family of Fringilliclce. Although M. Cuvier in his
‘⁶ αἶς-110 Animal'' 11115 pointed out some well-defined divisions of
the family, yet there still 10111111115 511011 a number of specics
belonging not merely to the Linnean Fringilla, but which have
indiscriminately 111111 apparently without any decided law of de-
11111101111011 been scattered by the strict followers of Linnaeus in
his genus Lamia, that many more subdivisions 1111151 yet be
efi'ected before the whole group can be placed in 1111 intelligible
111111 1111111110115 011101. The few species 111111 000111 in the New
Holland collection do not afl'ord us materials or opportunity for
1111011109,- any light at present upon the subject. They are
chiefly well-known species ; 111111 we shall introduce them without
any attempt 111 111010 accurate arrangement, under the compre-
hensive genus Fringilla.
