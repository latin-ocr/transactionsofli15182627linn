{386 „Una Vmons's ancl Dr. HORSFIELD'S Description oftlee

'l’here was no specimen of this species in the collection ori—
ginally brought to this country by Mr. Caley. That gentleman,
however, makes the following reference to this bird, when speak-
ing of the N. pulchellus. ‘⁶ that is called the Ground Pal-rot at
Sydney inhabits the scrubs in that neighbourhood. I have also
seen it in similar situations elsewhere. I have never seen it
except on the wing3 it having started up before me, taking a
short ssight, and alighting among the bushes, but never to my

knowledge upon them.’'—-Our specimen was obtained by Mr.
Brown at Port Phillip, January 25th‚ 1804.

Rostrum subcrassum; mandibula superiore dilatata, culmine ro-
tundo: inferiore lata, brevi, emarginat-[1.

simis ; secundae tertiae et quartae pogoniis externis in medio
gradatim latioribus.

Gauda gradata3 rectricibus duabus mediis gracillimis, caeteras
longitudine magnopere excedentibus.

‘she birds of this genus, which are of peculial· interest as
having formed the group of Pam-ots known to the ancients, are
distinguished at once from those of the conterminous genera by
the form of the tail, in which the two middle feathers con—
siderably exceed the others in length. Other distinguishing
characters may also be observed on comparing the generic de-
scriptions. The group belongs chiefly to India, and some of
the neighbouring islands in the Indian Ocean. One species
only has been found in New Holland. This seems to possess
