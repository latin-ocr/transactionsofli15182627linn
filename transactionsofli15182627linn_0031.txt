115 song exactly like that os a Blackbird, but always ends with
its own. Its general habits are similar to those of the Yellow
NVren : for, like that bird, it seems constantly in motion, hopping
about. from bough to bough iu search of 11159915, and singing at
intervals.

7. S. cium-ea (White-throat, Hay-jack).

8. S. Carruca (Lesser thite-throat).

We have noticed the Lesser White-throat more 1111111 01199 at
Starston, and have also procured its eggs at the same place. It
appears to be not uncommon in the neighbourhood of Diss, at
which place we have seen several nests belonging to this species.
In the month os .l 1111Γ 1820, we observed a Lesser V'hite-tlnoat
very busy in picking the Aplzis lanigera from 1119 ripple-trees.
This bird often utters a remarkably curious and fine-drawn note,
scarcely 10 be heard. It also Warblcs 501111Υ and finely, 115 Mon-
tagu observes: and before its common note clm, lu, lu, ln, it
usually begins with a short and gentle warble.

9. S. Rubecula (Red-breast).

10. S. Plzanicnrzls (Redstart, Firetail).

Perhaps the Redstart sings earlier and later than any other
diurnal songster. We have heard it singing after 1911 o'clock at
night, and at three the following morning. A Redstart, which
built in our garden in the summer of 1819, adopted part of the
song of a Lesser White-throat, which much frequented the same
place; and its imitation was 50 exact as sometimes to deceive the
nicest ear. Almost all the summer warblers are, more or less,
mock-birds.

11. S. Hippolais (Lesser Pettychaps, thite-throat).
