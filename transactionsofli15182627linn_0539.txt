systems and methods. The naturalist has attempted only to
carry this necessary operation of the mind somewhat further
and with more precision, and has thus exposed himself to errors,
which the vulgar have escaped. Thus, although there are but
two modes of reasoning; namely, by the use of words expressive
of an individual and its attributes, or by general words indica-
tive of an aggregation of individuals with their common attri-
butes3 yet naturalists have used their terms in a different sense,
and have invented additional ones, such as order, tribe, colzort,
firmil? , class, by which theyattempt to express with more accuracy
larger generalizations than they would do by employing a ge-
neric term, and as if they could settle the relative rank of the
different groups whose existence they have assumed. Whereas
the truth is, that in many instances a class may be equivalent to
an order or a genus. These different gradations, thus strictly
aimed at, are gratuitous assumptions with which Nature has
nothing to do ; and which frequently lead to the establishment
of false hypotheses.

It was the opinion of Linnaem, and continues to be the opinion
of some of his (liscipleS‚ that genera are actually founded in na-

genus.'' Phil. Rot. ᾗ 162. ‘⁶ Genus omne est naturale, 111 pri-
mordio tale creatum, hinc pro lubitu et secundum cujuscunque
theoriam non proterve discindendum aut conglutinandum.‘¹‘
Ib. ξ 159. So the excellent and elegant author of the ‘⁶ Intro-
duction to Physiological and Systematic Botany,'’ says, “ A
genus comprehends one or more species so essentially different

other plants, asto constitute a distinct family 01· kind 1101655

than the different species of such a genus. Thus in the animal
