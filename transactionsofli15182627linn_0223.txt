If the several birds, which have been described as varieties ot'
the Αἶα-σεῖο sacra of Gmelin, be actually found to belong to that
species, our bird may probably be added to the list. W e have
however much doubt of their being mere varieties. In the spe-
cies of Kingsfislzers which have been well ascertained, we find
little variation of plumage3 and we seldom observe such an
extensive geographical distribution among them as is assigned
to the Alceclo sacra. The various groups of this family inore-
over approach so nearly to each other in their characters,
particularly in the distribution of their colom-s, that we need
not be surprised at finding that most of the Kingssislzers of
the islands of the Indian Ocean bear a general resemblance to
each other, so as to appear at first sight varieties of one species.
We have not materials sufficient in Europe to enable us to com<¹
to any decision on this subject: that must be determined on the
spot. But with respect to our New Holland bird, we consider our-
selves justified in keeping it distinct from the sacred Ki21gsfislm·‚
until at least some strong grounds are advanced to prove it the
same. It differs both from Dr. Latham’s and Gmelin's original
descriptions of Alceclo sacra, which were taken from a bird
belonging to the Friendly Islands, by having a conspicuous
collar round the neck3 by the under parts being yellowish-
white, varied with ferruginous and undulated with slight fuscous
’ fascice, instead of being pure wl1ite2 and by having a black
streak running longitudinally before and behind the eye, with a
black collar margining the hind part of the head, and a conspi-
cuous white spot adjoining this collar on the occiput. The Alcedo
sacra, moreover, is described as being more than nine inches in

length, Gmelin making it nine and a half, while our bird scarcely
exceeds
