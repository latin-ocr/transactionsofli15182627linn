214 ‚Ur-fx'mons’saml D2·.Hons1-1E1,D's Description qf'ffie

This Ιφουρ, which by its straight and rather lengthened bill
appears to come into the subfamily of leamnoplzilimt among the
Slcrilces, may probably be considered the representative in Aus-
tralia of the ¹South American 'l'lmmnoplu'li and the African 1ΊΙαῖα-
ςοηοΐὶ. From both those <genera it differs in its entirer even
tail; in its wings being comparatively longer, although rounded
as in those generag and in the paratarsia being entire instead of
being furnished with either large but distant, or small but nu—
merous, scales. We have been enabled to ascertain nothing of
the habits of the group : but 115 general appearance points out
the situation we at present assign it; while at the same time it
has also some general resemblance to the neighbouring family
of the Tltruslees. The present subfamih', it is to be observed, is
that which connects the Laniadae with the last-mentioned family
sslernlicloe .· and this approaching conformity to the Thy-ashes in
the birds which compose the extreme and connecting group of
the Shrilses is therefore to be expected. We have assigned the
genus a name indicative of these approaching affinities.

ΜΓ. Caley has noted these two birds as sexes os the same
species. IIe adds, that they frequented at times the neighbour-
hood of liis house, and were found 111 the green cattle-trees.
The eyes he described as black. The weight of the male was
(ἒξ ounces.
