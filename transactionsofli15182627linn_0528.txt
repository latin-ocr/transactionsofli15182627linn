loose and porous texture of its 1101165, 111111 1116 cartilaginous nature
of their extremities.

I cannot suffer the present opportunity to pass by, without
suggesting the possibility of Dr. Abel having been materially
deceived in his estimate, taken from the dried skin‚ of the height
of his animal, which he computes at no less than 7 feet 6 inches ;
for he calculatos, that the extent of his reach from finger to finger
across the chest did not exceed 8 feet 2 inches3 whereas in the
skeleton of the Pongo at the College of Surgeons, whose arms I
believe to be shorter in proportior] to its height than in the true
Satyrus, and which is probably the same species he has described,
—-in 11115 Pongo I find the extent of reach to be not less than 7
feet, and yet its height does not exceed 3 feet ll inches: and
consequently‚ if what I have presumed be found correct, were
it a Satyrus instead of a Pongo, with a 1611611 of 7 feet, its height
would scarcely exceed ὃ feet and a half. It is highly worthy
of notice, as relating to the proportions of Orang Otangs, that
with av reach of 7 feet, each arm being 3 feet l inch in length,
this Pongo measures only 2 feet 2 inches from the summit of the
head 10 1116 extremity of the os coc-cygn, and only 1 foot 10 inches
111 1116 length of its hindei· extremities‚ or from the top of the head
of the os femoris to the under surface of the OS calcis. The hindei·
hand of this creature is at the same time 110 more than ‘2 inches
shorter than that of the animal described by Dr. Abel, being 12
11161165 111 length.

From the capacity and form of the pelvis, and other circum-
stances, I have reason to believe the skeleton at the College of
Surgeons to be that of a female, while there is as strong evidence
that Cuvier's larger skeleton of 1116 same species is that ofa male.
Having been favoured with accurate admcasurements made of the
Parisian specimen by Mr. Clist, it may not be considered irrele-
vant to our subject to compare some ofits proportions with those
