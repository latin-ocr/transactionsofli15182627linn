23 Messrs. SHEPPARD and XVIIITEAR'S Catalogue

a very extraordinary migration of small birds was witnessed at
Little Oakley in Essex. The attention of the observer was
arrested by an unconnnon chattering of birds, and looking up
he beheld an incredible number of small birds flying a-breast‚
in a line extending as far as the eye could distinguish them, and
three or four yards deep. Their direction was towards the south-
east, the wind favouring thenr: their height only a few yards
from the ground. The flock was supposed to consist principally of
Chaffinches, Linnets, TwiteS‚ and Bramblings. None of the two
latter species were seen in the neighbourhood after that time:
and there is on those shores in the winter season an immense
quantity of Linnets, more than can be bred in the neighbour-

hood.

9. F. Spinus (Siskin).

Small fiocks of Siskins are occasionally seen in Norfolk and
Suffolk during the winter season, particularly in severe weather.
A flock of them was observed at Sturston as late as the 4111 ot'
March, 1820. They kept up a constant twittering as they fiew
briskly from tree. to tree, apparently for the purpose of keeping
the fiock together. The twittering of this bird very much re-
sembles that of the Lesser Redpole.

lo. F. Linaria (Lesser Redpole).

11. F. Cat-(ludis (Goldfinch).

Genus XXIV. CUCULus.
1. C. canorus (Cuckoo).

The opinion still prevails among the vulgar in Suffolk, 11131
Cuokoos are transformed into Hawks in winter.—On J uly 31st,
