cula at a right angle; but becoming attached to this projec-
tion of the clavicle, receives from the point described its cen-
trical direction into the body. 'l'he whole length of the wind-
pipe in this bird is 4 feet 8 inches.

Ἕως. XIV. is a representation of the trachea of the second
bird before referred to, and was also a male. lt will be observed
to want partos the interesting character of the first specimen,
which the particular direction occupied by the leading portion
of the tube in this second renders unnecessary : but the enlarged
clavicle in this bird is on the right side, having a similar projec-
tion on its inner surface, forming a point of attachment for the
tube, and performing the same office as in the other instance.
It will reinain for future investigation to show, whether in those
male birds possessing the extra convolutions of the trachea, the
enlarged clavicle is uniformly on the left side, and vice τεν-Μ).
lf'our species of birds belonging to the Gallinaceous tribe have
been tignred by Dr. Latham as possessing convolutions of the
trachea of various extent on the outside of the pectoral muscles :
the same parts have also been represented on a larger scale by
Mons. Temminck in his Histoire Naum-elle Gc‘vffrale (les Pigeons
et des Gallinacffs, and are described as possessing voices exceed—
ingly harsh and loud. In this particular the Semipalmated Goose
agrees perfectly; and in those species of Cranes and Swans
already referred to, the power and depth of tone will be found
to increase with the elongation of the tube.

Of the true pl‘iysiology of these variations in form and length-
ened convolutions little is known: that a connection exists be-
tween the sexu-al organs and those of the voice many proofs might„
be adduced ; and it is not the least singular property of these sin-
gularly formed windpipes, that the inore complicated the struc-
ture of the tube, the more disagreeable is the sonnd of the voice,
the simple forms belonging to our most delightful song-birds.
