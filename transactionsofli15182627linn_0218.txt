In Mr. Caley's MSS. are the following notices of this bird.
“ Its native name is Natay’lsim the settlers call it Dollar Bircl,
from the silver-like spot on the wing—It is a noisy bird when on
1116 wing, but 111051151 50 111 1116 6116111113, after other birds have
gone to roost. It may then both be heard and seen on the tops of
trees, particularly on dead branches, where it is most easily shot
by so exposing itself. Its flight is much like that of the Swalloze,
but I have never observed it long upon the wing ; as it generally
betakes itself‚ as I before mentioned, 10 1116 1ορ of 501116 high
tree or decayed branch, from whence it darts more readily upon
its prey. At 11115 111116 (1116 evening) the Bcetlcs‚ which Ι have
found in their stomachs‚ are upon the wing.—It 15 11 bird of pas-
sage—The earliest period of the year at which Ι have noticed it
was 011 1116 ard of October 1809 ·, and I have missed it early in
February. It is most plentiful about Christmas.''

This bird, which seems to spread itself very generally over
the Eastern world, was originally placed by Linnaeus among-'the
Romane, or his genus Coracias,· and although it has latterly been
formed into a distinct genus from that group, it has still been
arranged next to it by the greater number of systematic writers.
M. Vieillot observing the extreme width of the base of the bill,
grouped it among the Rev-r‘y-ectters³⁵‚ a family which he formed
