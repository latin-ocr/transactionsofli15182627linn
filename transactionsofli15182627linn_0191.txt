Indian ocean, or which, according to the varied laws that regu-
late the geographical distribution of the groups of ornithology,
are scattered almost indiscriminately over the globe. Beyond
these few instances, not only every species is new, but almost
every form is distinct from those which were familiar to Euro-
peans half a century ago. For such productions consequently
no generic names or minuter characters are to be found in the
works of Linnaeus. And when we consider the totally new and
apparently anomalous peculiarities of these productioris, it would
not be altogether unreasonable to suppose that no place could
be found, even in the greater divisions of his general system,
where they might be assembled according to their natural affi-
nities. But this is far from being the case. His mode of in-
terpreting the general laws of nature was so penetrating, and at
the same time so comprehensive, that provision is made in his
primary and leading divisions even for these novelties and
apparent anomalies. In including them, therefore, within the
pale of his system, merely by partially modisying and liberally
interpreting it,—and interpreting it solely according to his own
instructions,-—instead of making the arrangement which includes
these productioris a large and unsightly excrescence of that
system, or a distinct, nay, a contradictory appendix to it, we
consider that we not merely do justice to the comprehensiveness
of his views, but confine ourselves within the strict principles of
the school which looks up to him as its founder.

W'e feel much gratification in being able to state, that since
we commenced our examination of the birds in the Society’s
collection, we have had the good fortune to obtain some valuable
information respecting the habits and internal structure of many
of the species ; and we may add, that we have a few important
facts in natural history to communicate, and several extensive
and strongly characterized groups to exhibit for the first time
