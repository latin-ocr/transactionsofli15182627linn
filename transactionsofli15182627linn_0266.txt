darts upon its prey. Itis, however, sufficiently distinguished from
Rlzipiclura hythe tail being even, not rounded, at the end. The
bill also is much more lengthened, more depressed‚ and stronger ι
and it is deficient in those elongated bristles which protect 1116
rictas of the preceding birds, The formation of the wing also
of both these genera will be observed, from the characters given
of each, to be materially different: and the marked scutellation
of the tarsi separates the. present group from the preceding, and
indeed from most of the ,Huscicapidce that we have as yet had an
opportunity of examining.

We find the following observations on this species in Mr. Ca-
ley's MSS. “This bird 15 called by the eolonists Dislzzeaslter.
lt is very curious in its actions. In alighting on a stump of a
tree it makes several semicircular 1110110115, spreading out 115 11111
at the time, and making a loud noise, somewhat like that caused
by a 1·aso1·-grinder when at work. l have seen it frequently
alight 011 1116 ridge of my house, and perform the same evolu-
110115. l have often considered it, when I witnessed these 1111111-
ners, to be the Wagtail of the colony—'l‘he stumps of trees 011
which it alights are those which have been left standing, where
the ground has been cleared ; the trees themselves having been
eut down about a yard from the g1·ound.''
