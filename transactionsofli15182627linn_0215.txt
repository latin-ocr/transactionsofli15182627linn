The birds of this genus in the Society’s collection bear such
a general resemblance to each other, that we have felt some
hesitation in describing them as different species. The caret'ul
examinatior] of many individuals in their own country will alone
determine with certainty whether they are distinct, οι· merely
varieties of the same species from age or sex. With respect to the
two foregoing species we have to observe that Dr. Lassram, by
»the examination of other subjects, has been led to the same result
as we have been by the comparison of the specimens in our
collection: and has described these birds respectively as the
lseclge-tailecl and Colcl Rirer Goatsuclsers. The chief differences
between them are as follows: The Pod. ›S'tanleyanus is some-
what larger than the Pocl. humeralis; the colour of its plumage
is more purely cinereous and brown, being almost without any
mixture of tawny ; the external marks are more delicate, and the
gape of the bill is wider. The Pocl. humeralis is distinguished

by bold black longitudinal streaks, some of which are of con—
siderable
