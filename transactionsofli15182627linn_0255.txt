species exhibit a resemblance to the birds of the genus Proculas,
Ill.‚ while by the puffed-out appearance of the seathers about
the head, we trace also an approximation to some of the Lin-
nean Pari. An approach in character may also be noticed
between them and the Mzcscicapae; among which, indeed, the
typical species of the present group has been hitherto placed.
The situations which we at present assign the group, 111 con-
sonance with the views exhibited on the subject 111 a preceding
volume of these 'Fi-a11sacti01is÷÷‚ will be found to einbrace all
these affinities, and to unite all the birds thus approaching each
other in one conterminous assemblage.
