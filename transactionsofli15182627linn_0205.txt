England: and the cuch-00, as they call this bird, singing by
night, is one of the instances which they point out. The z‘re‘des
are yellow.’' In his references to one of the specimens in the
collection, a young male, Mr. Caley notices some variation in
the colour of the irides.

This bird much rcsembles the last species. Having however
seen several specimens of it in fine preservation, we are at pre-
sent inclined to consider it distinct. The chief points on which
we ground this opinion are, that the latter bird is much smaller
than N. Boobook, the colour is less ferruginouS, and the white
spots are much more frequent, and distinctly marked. The
fascia? on the tail-feathers also in our bird are more conspi-
cuous.
