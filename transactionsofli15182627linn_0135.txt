From the name given to it by the Brahmans of Malabar it
would appear to have come from lXIalacca.

The Malabar generic name is Posti,- and Nele', prefixed as a
specific appellation, implies a resemblance to the Mla· or Phyl-
lantlms Emblica of Linnoeus, a more just and striking compa-
rison than European naturalists for a long time pointed out; for
they copied the error of Rheede in considering it as of the same
genus with the Bilimhi. Pouli, as a generic name, seems also
to be used in the Canta-puli, which is mentioned in the first
part of the Hortus Μαίαῦανὶειω, p. 42, as belonging to what is
now called an ancarpns. T he chief resemblance here 15,
11131 1116 1111115 of the two trees are nearly of the same size,
colour, and taste. Rheede’s classing it with the Bilimhi is very
little if at all better. ’1116 1131116 Αηωιίἰῖὶ5, which 116 says is used
by the Brahmans of Malabar, is probably derived from the
Arabio Ambela (for the tree is no doubt 311 6Χο110 111 India Pro-
per), and was probably introduced from the Eastern islands by
the Arabs of Malabar, who traded to that quarter long before
the arrival of Europeans.

Plukenet (A lm. 45.) thought that 1116 Νεῖἰ Ροιιῐιῖ might be his
Avhor Malabarica Fraarim' fer& folio, ossiculo fructus octangalari
(Phyt. t. 269. f. (3.), which would appear to be a dehj«, and
therefore to be at least of the 531116 natural order ; but it 061-
tainly is 3 different plant: and he 15 1116 1655 excusable in this
error, because he had described the real Nelc' Ροιιῖί 11111161 1116
1131116 of Clzcramei Acostcejblio Pyrc' (filant. 45), a name that had
been given to it by John Bauhin.

Rumphius (Herb. Amb. vii. 33. t. 17.) gives an excellent ac-
count of the tree under the name Cheramela, but does not 01355
