This species very much resembles the former in all its general
characters, not only of form but of marking: the outlines, how—
ever, are more strongly marked, the general appearance ruder,
and the shape more flattened and expanded. It. is of a dull
brown colour, with yellowish blotches along the sides, and the
internal part of the marginal plates, where the head and extre-
1nities pass, of a rich deep red. The gibbous projection of the
back is so considerable as to form a right angle. The second,
third and fourth vertebral scuta are very irregularly hexagonal,
and the second and third costal as irregularly pentagonal, the
sides of each figure being extremely unequal. The anterior
marginal plates project to a greater extent than in K. castanea,
and the whole of the marginal scuta arc more horizontal and
more expanded. They are ‘24 in number, having, in addition
to those of the other species, a long, linear, pointed, single one
between the tirst pair. The joint which renders the hindei·
part of the back moveable is similar in its structure and
situation to that of K. castanea, but 15 even more strongly
marked. The anterior part of the sternum does not project,
as in that speeies, beyond the upper 511011, nor 15 its bifid ex-
tremity so long and pointed.

Mr. Gray informs 1110, that the specimens which are in the
Eritish Museum came from Sierra Leone, and were collected by
Lieut. M. C. Friend, RN. He states, that according to that
gentleman's accountv the. back part moved considerably when

the animal was alive.
