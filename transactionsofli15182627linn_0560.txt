June 7, ΟΝ the retirement of Alexander MacLeuy, Esq.‚ F.R.S.‚
1825. ἃς. from the office of Seeretary of the Society‚ the
following Minute, recommended by the Council, was
adopted by the Generul Meeting ofthe above date, viz.

‘⁶ The Linnean Soeiety of London take the earliest
opportunity, after the retirement of Alexander Mae-

Leay, Esq. from the Secretaryship of the Society‚ to
record upon their Minutes the high estimation in which

he is held by thern, on account of twenty-seven years of
unremitted and unrequited labour devoted to science:

and that in quitting, for a time, this sphere of usefulness,

to fill an honourable station in a distant country, he
carries with him the cordial esteem and sincere regret

of this Society.''

Read a Letter from Mr. Charles W⁷illcox, accom-
panied by Specimens of Mytilus bidens, found by him
adhering to the bottom of His Majesty’s ship Welleslev,
which had nine years before arrived from India, but
had not from that time quitted Portsmouth harbour.
The species appears to propagate itself readily: and
it seems very probable that it has become naturalized
in the harbour, ΜΓ. ἮἯΙΟΟΧ having found large masses
of them.
