of which the common European species is an adequate example.
In that genus, which forms part of the typical group of the
Fissirostral tribe of the insessor-es, the chief characters that dis—
tinguish the birds of the tribe are strongly developecl, namely,
the powers of ssight and of receiving their foocl within the wide
gape of their bill when on the wing. The chief strength of the
bird is thus centred in the wings and the rictas of the bill ; and
a proportional deficiency takes place in those other members
which are less necessary to it in the performance of its peculial·
functions. The bill itself is feeble, and apparently useless in
securing its prey, which object is effected chiefly by a viscous
exudation within the gape, and a regularly disposed net'work os
strong bristles, which externally margins the rictus. The legs
