to mention that a pair of the scm-nas militaris, Linn.‚ a species
also belonging· to this family, have been presented to the So-
ciety by a gentleman who received them with other birds from
New Holland. The species has hitherto been considered ex-
clusively South American: and as the skins of our birds might
easily have been imported from America into Now Holland, we
consider it extremely doubtful that they were nutives of the

not merely the fact of the wide dispersion of a specieS‚ but of
the existence of a. group in New Ilolland as yet unnoticed there ;
and we therefore consider it prudent merely to state the above
circumstances without any further comment.

“ The birds of this species‚’' Mr. Caley informs us, “ are gre-
garious, and found only in particular places. In the. morning
they make a loud whistling noise high up in the trees—The
nativos call the species Ca'ruclc: and they tell me it builds its
nest of sticks lined with grass in Iron-harh and ripple-trees (a
species of Angopltora). It has three young 011eS.——',l'liese birds
