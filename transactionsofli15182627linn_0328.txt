Mr. Caley thus observes on this species.—“ This bird is most
frequently met with in the trees growing in scrubs, where the
different species of Banltsicz are found, the flowers of which I
have reason to think afford it a sustenance during winter. In
the summer Ι have shot it when sucking the flowers of Leptosper-

mum flavescens. In the scrubs about Paramatta it is very com-
mon.”

M. Vieillot's Heorotaire noir (pl. 71.), which seems accurately

AuthorS, is the only assemblage of these birds of which we can speak with any satis-

faction to ourselves. The species accord in their general characters3 and in their

habits and the structure of their tongue the)⁷ are represented as agreeing most perfectly.

They exliibit five prominent modifications of form, according to the variation chiefly of

the characters of the bill and tail. At present we wish to consider these types of form

as sections only of the group, which we name provisionally the genus IlIeIJ'phaga.

W hen the species become more known, the present sections may justly be considered

genera, and the higher group may be denominated the subfamily JlIeliplmgiua. WVhen

this subdivision takes place, the section which stands first in our text may be considered
the true ssleliphoga. The Mel. Nora' Hollamlioe will form the type. It may thus be
characterized.
