Dr. FRANCIS HAMILTON'S Commentary, (50, 79

much to be regretted that in the indexes to the Hortus Alala-
haricus, not only in the work itself, but in the Flora ,Z'eylanica of
Linnaeus, and Thesaurus Z'eylanicus of Burman, the plants have
been arranged according to their specific, and not according to
their generic names3 for in the dialects of India, as well as in
English, the specific name usually precedes the generic. There
are some exceptions z—-the Malabar words RIm-am signifying a
tree, Kodc' a, sarmentose plant, Valle· a climber, Pulla a grass,
and Illaravara a parasitical plant, are usually placed after the
generic term, being properly denominations of classes or orders.
In the same manner Glzas Gaya or Galea (herba, planta) in the
dialect of Ceylon is to be considered not as denoting a genus,
but a class or order. Keeping this in mind, the classitication
of the natives may be readily discovered, and in general will be
found to show a considerable accuracy of observation.

The name Kar—effla, said to be given to this palm by the
Brahmans of Malabar‚ I cannot explain ; unless we suppose it
composed of two words, Κανᾶ and Tela, the former signifying
wild3 and the latter may be the same with Tala or Tali, the
Ceylonese name. This is obviously the same with Tal, the
name given in the north of India to the Borassus flabellffbrmss,
to which the Codda Parma has a very great resemblance. The
term Glzas Gaya or Galla, annexed by the Ceylonese, I have
already explained; but the word Pot added to Tala· is the same
with Pata or leaf, annexed because the leaf of this palm is the
part most commonly used.

Commeline, in the note annexed, seems to have an unneces-
sary doubt in referring to the Codcla Panna C. ssauhin’s Arbor
foliis sex brachiorum longis, cajus folio ertenso tres quatuorve vire]
in itinere operiuntur, ut pluvias non metuant. Except in coining
a new name, Ray, as usual with Indian plants, gives us no

knowledge but what is derived from Rheede ; and the same is
