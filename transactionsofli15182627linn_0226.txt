On proeeeding to 1116 Dentirostral Tribe of the Perching
Birds, and eonnneneing with the family of Laniaslae which forms
partos the typieal group of that tribe, we find representatives
of most of the greater subdivisions of the family among the
Australian birds. One subdivision alone 15 wanting, the sub-
family of Tyrannina, Swains. 'I'hat group, or at least the typi-

exclusively to the Old W01·ld; and speeiinens of two os its
most prominent gr0up5, the genera Arsanias and Diei-arus, are
in our collection. 'l'here appea]·s‚ however, 501116 difl'el‘ence in
the geographioal distribution of these two forms: the speeies of
Artamzcs being chiefly inhabitants of the islands in 1116 southern
Ocean, while those of Dim-urus extend their lzabitats from the
continents of Africa and India to the neighbouring islands.
