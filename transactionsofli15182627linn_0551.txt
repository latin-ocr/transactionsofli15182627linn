of Pinus, native of Calzfornia. 499

about twice as long as the seed; it has an innumerable quantity
of minute sinuous vessels filled with a crimson substance, and
forming a most beautiful microscopic object. 'she elnbryo has
12 or 13 cotyledons.

The whole tree produces an abundance of pure amber-
coloured resin. Its timber is white, sost, and light: it abounds
in turpentine reservoirs, and its specific gravity has been as-
certained from a specimen brought home by me, to be 0463.
The annual layers are very narrow; in the above specimen
there were 56 in the space of four inches and a half next the
outside. 'l'he resin, which exudes from the trees when they
are partly burned, loses its usual flavour, and acquires a sweet
taste, in which state it is used by the natives as sugar, being
mixed with their food. The seeds are euten roasted, or are
pounded into coarse cakes for their winter storc. I have since
my return been informed by Mr. Menzies, that when he was on
the coast of California with Captain Vancouver in 1795, seeds
of a large Pine, resembling those of the Stone Piis, were served
in the dessert by the Spanish priests resident there. These
were no doubt the produce of the species now noticed. The
vernacular name of it, in the language of the Umptqua Indians,
is Nat-cleb.

The species to which this Pine is most nearly allied is un-
doubtedly Pinus Strolms; from which, however, it is extremely
different in station, habit, and parts of fructification I have
named it in compliment to Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., a
Vice-President of the Linnean Society, whose splendid labours
in investigating the genus Pinus are too generally known and
appreciated to require any eulogium froin nie.

It only now remains for me to give the distinctive character
of the species.
