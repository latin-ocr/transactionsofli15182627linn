Linnaeus (Η. ,Συ-111. 390.) however entirely adopted the opinion
of Burman, and supposed the Indi Palm to be the same with
that which produces (10105, 011(1 10 110 50 common in India that
it had communicated its name to the country. This opinion,
however, could only be adopted on the supposition that the Kalon

for in the dialects of 1110 North of India the Katoa lnclel is called
Klijur in the vulgar, and Khwjuri in the sacred dialect (Ka-
som-i of the Brahmans of Malabar) ; and it was no doubt. from
some circumstance attending the North of India, that the West-
