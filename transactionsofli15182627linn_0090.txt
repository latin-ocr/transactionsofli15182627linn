remember to have seen it. In my Journey to RIysore (ii. 488.)
I have given an account of the uses to which it is applied ; and
Ι must further observe that, notwithstanding its size and woody
texture, this plant, like our annuals of Europe, produces fruc—
tification only once, and then dies; whereas many herbae-,eous
