There are two specimens of this bird in the collection, one of
which is marked by Mr. Caley as a young male, the other as a
female. It is probable that the adult male may differ from
both. The eyes are noted as being black. Their weight is
14 drachms.

Two birds of this species were presented to the Society by
Mr. Brown, which he met with on the South coast of New Hol-
land. A third bird, presented also by that gentleman, was
found by him on the East coast. It varies from the other
two in the upper colour being more plumbeous. This may be
a distinct species: but all the specimens are in bad condition,
and it is impossible to make any decision respecting them, par-
ticularly in a group where the colours are in general indistinct.
