Aclea in the month of June 1817. And about the same time ει
female of this species was killed near Burgh Castle‚ and another
in the month of November following.

Last year two young Storks were taken from a nest in Hollanu,
and given to Mr. Harrison. They have borne the winter, though
not without much shivering on the coldest days, on which they
were always observed to be more than usually voracious. Each of
them has swallowed two rats which were more than half-grown:
and whilst the tail of the second was hanging out of the bill a
third has more than once been attempted. On these cold days,
when Mr. H. has been cutting horse-fiesh for them, so voracious
have they been that he was fearful of cutting the ends of their
bills as they darted at their food. They rest much on one leg ;
and are fond of wading into a pond, from which they procure
some kind of food, though there are no fish therein.

Genus XLVI. ARDEA.

1. Α. cinerea (Common Heron).

We once watched the motions of a Heron which was standing
by the side of a river, where the bank was rather steep: in
dartin g at a fish he precipitated himself into the water, but was
out again in an instant with his prey. When a Heron has caught
a large eel‚ it carries it upon firm land, and dashes it repeatedly
with violence against the ground, till the fish is so weakened
that it can be swallowed with ease. The edges of both the
mandibles of this bird are sharp, which structure enables it more
securely to hold its slippery prey.

We remarked in a paper already laid before the Society, that
the feathers of this species are frequently loaded with a blue
powder. We have since noticed an abundance of white dust
upon the feathers of the breast and belly of a White Owl killed
