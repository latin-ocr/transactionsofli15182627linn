on the end of October, and inclosed in glass phials with ground
stoppers, where they were suffered to remain till the 16111 of
December, an interval of seventy-tive days, without either food
or moisture; yet at the expiration of that period, the only alte-
rations perceptible in their external condition were a small de-
crease in bulk, and a slightly wrinlzled appearance, particularly
of the abdomen z but their functions were seemingly unim-
paired; for on warin dayS‚ or when excited by artificia} heat,
they were lively in their motions‚ and to the last continued
to produce their threads, which were often destroyed for the
purpose of ascertaining whether they would be replaced by
others with apparently the same facility as at the time of their
capture.

It is particularly deserving of notice, that these insects, though
unable to climb up the smooth perpendicular sides of the phials
on their first introduction, soon contrived to traverse the interior
of their prisons in every direction.

In order to illustrate their manner of proceeding on this occa-
sion, the case of an individual has been selected for descrip-
tion,—the same method, with a few trivial modifications‚ being
pursued by all. Elevating the abdomen, and pressing the spin—
ning—apparatus against the side of the phial, this spider emitted
from its papillae a little viscous fluid, which on exposure to the
air hardened into a minute semi-transparent speck ; then moving
to a short distance, and drawing out a thread after it, one end of
which remained fixed to the spot it had just quitted, it connected
this filament with another part of the phial by applying the
spinners as before. Several lines being thus produced, the
spider speedily raising itself upon them above the bottom of the
phial, promoted its undertaking by repeating the process just
described ; every step so gained enabling it to carry its opera-
tions still higher.
