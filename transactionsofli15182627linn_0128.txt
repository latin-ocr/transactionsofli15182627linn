Commeline in his note mentions the resemblance between this
tree and the 'Pupia of Brazil described by Piso: but he only
says, ‘⁴ Putamus duas hasce arbores, si non easdem, saltem esse
species persimiles.'’ Plukenet (Δίνη. 34; Phyt. t. 137. f. 7.)
described what he called Apioscoroclon, 011 account of its having
the smell of Garlic, and seems uncertain whether he should
refer it to the Niirvula of India or Tapiu of Brazil. He had also
procured another plant from America, which he called Arbor
Americana triphyllu, numerosis staminulis, purpureis· ultricibus prce—
ditisfloris umbilicum occupantibus (A lm. 47 ; Ι)Ιι]]ΐ. t. 147. f. 6.),
which he also refers with doubt to the Niirvalu; thus probably
implying that he considered all the three as belonging to the
same genus.

In the Floro ,zcylanica (211.) Linnaeus mentions the Nilrvola
from a drawing taken in Ceylon by Hermann, and considered it
as without doubt the same with the first plant of Plukenet, which
in the Hortus Clg'ffortiunus he had called Crotccvu inermis; but
the Nih-vala has not the 5111611 of Garlic : sollu manibus confricta
suaveolentia—florum odor suavissimus et vinosus—finctus odoris
vinosi.- while the leaves of the American plant, as represented by
Plukenet‚ are much broader in proportion to their length than
those of the Nurvala. But further, Linnaeus along with the
Tapia of Brazil and 1116 Niirvalu of India, joined the second
plant of Plukenet, above mentioned, from Jamaica; for although
he does not quote Plukenet twice, he quotes a plant described
by Sloane and Ray, which is no doubt the same with that of
Plukenet; and this also has the smell of Garlic. The younger
Burman (Fl. Iud. 109), although Linnaeus in the Species Plan—
