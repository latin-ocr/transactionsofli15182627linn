This species does not possess the velvet-like covering to the
›mr-cs which is so conspicuous 111 1116 preceding species of Ptilo-
norlzgsnclms. In its other characters, however, it sufficiently
accords with the gr0up3 and by the deficiency in 1116 covering
of the base of the bill may be looked upon as forming the pas-

specimen 111 1116 Linnean collection was met with by Mr. {rown
at V'atham's River, November 1804.

garious, and seems to prefer elevated situations, 01· such as
