One ofour specimens ofthis species was brought by Mr. Brown
from the banks of the Derwent, where he obtained it in 1804.
It appears to be the bird from which the late M. Kuhl took the
description of his Psittacus auso-alis (J). 48. 710. 74). He refers to
a specimen in the Linnean Society's collection, and there is no
other bird in that collection which accords with his description.
We do not observe any material difference between our speci-
men and the Psitt. discolor of Dr. Latham. 'l'he front is some-
what more yellow than is usual in the species 3 and when the bird
is compared with M. Le Vaillant's figure, in which the front is
pure scal-let, a slight difference appears, which may have given
rise to M. Kuhl's separating the two birds. In most of the
birds, however, which are considered to belong to M. Le Vail-
lant's species Perruclze Banlcs, and Dr. Latham’s P. discolor, a
greater or less proportion os this yellow marking 15 discernible.
M. Le Vaillant's figure appears to 115 100 highly coloured.
Mr. Swainson’s is an excellent representation of the bird. There

join Palam-nis by the osculant species Pal. Papummiffi and fifthly, the species of
various countries, known by the general title of Perruclzes proprement dits, including
lssrvsogeris, V., united to Loriets of the last subdivſsion by Psitl.*si-ingillareus, Latis„
and leading round again to the first subdivision of l'arralseet Mamm-s by some Anie-
rican species, whose bills gradually shortening, and becoming stronger, indicate an
approaeliing allinity 10 that group.
