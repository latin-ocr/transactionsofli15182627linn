108 Dr. FRANCIS HAMILTON’s Commentary

rendum propono, an Panitsjilva-maram‚ i.e. Janipaba Pisonis
ut censet Connnelinus, sit (16 hujus genere (Diospgsros nempe)
plantarum, vel non ;'' and again, treating of the Genilmt of the
Α11111165, inisled by the authority of Connncline, he sayS, “ ,111111-
paba Pisonis ab hac diversa est, 61 1011ιῖι idem 60111 ΡιιφιίΐξίίΙιῚι.
quae potius de Anonarum seu Mespilorum Sappadilliae dictorum
genere est, 01 1116611111 existimo.'' Now, although he was proba-
bly wrong in considering the Janipalm (1111616111 fron] the Genipat,
because the latter 15 quite different from the I’auitsjilca, yet. he
pointed out an affinity in the Pateit.3jilf(z to the Sappaslillia or
Arm-as, 11111611, although one os ι1115516115 sapone, has certainly a
consideral‘sse affinity 10 1116 Gteqjaccmoe, to which 1116 l’c111it3jilm
belongs.

M. Desrousseaux (Eue. „Uetlr iii. 171.), although he 061010111-
ledged the resemblance which this tree bears 10 11 Diospyros,
considered its character, as given by Rheede, to point 001 115
being a Gareiuiu, and accordingly calls it Caminia malalmrica.

Gsertner (De Sem. i. 145. t. 29. f. 2.), although he did not
quote the 1³1121it.5j2'lcc1‚ is generally supposed to have described it
under 1116 11111116 of Emboeysopleris peregrina, and to have probably
been niisled by the representation of the fruit at the bottom of
the plate in the Hortus ilIalabaricus, which by some inistake is
drawn inverted, and by the expression in the description, Frac-
tus in vertice umbilico przecliti. Owing to these circumstances,
he iinagined that the fruit was erowned by the calyx, in
place of being contained in it; and of course could not consider
it as a Dios-pyros. Dr. Roxburgh, unwilling 10 change the ge—
neric name given by 50 good a botanist‚ when he published his
Flora CoromanAeliana, although perfectly aware of the situation
of the calyx, called the plant Embtyopteris glutinifera‚—a name
and genus continued by lVilldenow (Sp. Pl. iv. 8:36), although
it is by 110 means certain that he has not described the same

plant
