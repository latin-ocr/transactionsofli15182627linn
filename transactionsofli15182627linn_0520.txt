468 Dr. SMl'rn’s Description of two Quadrupeds

any of this grease was to be seen, I was not a little surprised 011
my return to find the quantity much increased, and therefore
determined if possible to ascertain from whence it was acquired.
With this view I had the post cleaned, and then concealed myself
so as to be unnoticed by the animal, and yet be able to see him.
Scareely was quietness established, when 116 approached theold
spot and commenced rubbing 1115 uates forcibly against the wood
101- about half a minute, and upon desisting an abundant supply
of the white greasy-looking substance was found to have been
deposited, which 116 6011111161166(1 consuming agreeably to the
mode already described. The rubbing-place was cleaned seve-
ral times, and as regularly as that was done, the loss was sup-
plied, till at last the animal finding all his exertions of no avail,
selected a large 510116 111 11 (11516111 corner of the building upon
which to form the deposit, and where 116 continued to place it as
long as he was annoyed. Since I first observed this habit, which
is now more than six months, Ι have never for many minutes
together seen the beam without more or less of the substance in
question: and whenever I have secretly watched the animal for
any time, Ι have seen him licking off and swallowing portioris
of it. He seldom finished a meal without betaking himself to
the beam3 he almost never rose from rest without making a.
similar journey, and he rarely at any time passed the deposit
without partaking of it. Is this secretion necessary for carrying
on the process of digestion‚ or for maintaining the regularity of
the functions of the alimentary canal?
