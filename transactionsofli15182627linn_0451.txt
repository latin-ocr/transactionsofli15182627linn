coveries in the characters and natural habits of this singular
race of insectsfss.

Disputations about the meaning of the ancients, and identi-
fying their descriptions with the modern species of natural
history, would perhaps, in a general way, be better avoided in
the valuable volumes of this Society, as leading to much desul-
tory and unsatisfactory discussion : practica] subjects and didac-
tic facts would perhaps better maintain their reputation. As,
however, the Society have in this instance already admitted the
discussion, it is but fair and just to allow the reply in the same
charmel, that the impression, if erroneous, may be removed.

W. S. MacLeay, in the paper alluded to, insists that the οἷἀ-τξος
of the ancients, and the Brizc or Breeze of the old English poets,
is not the (Estrus of the lnoderns; and he infers this from the
anatomical characters which some of the ancient. authors have
left us of their insect. Now, besides the anatomical descriptions
to be found in the works of philosophers‚ there is another mode
of identifying the insect; and that is, by the description of the
effects it produces upon cattle, and which are so singular, that
they have afforded incidents to most mral poets, ancient and
modern: and the truth seems to be, that the poets in describing
these effects have been true to nature; while the philosopher-s,
being presented with a wrong insect, have only involved the
subject in error.

'l'hat it is an Italian insect we have the authority of Valli-
sneri ot' Padua, who appears to have been the tirst naturalist
who bred the true (Iu'strus Bovis from the grubs found in the
backs of the cattle ; and for the first time, as far as we possess
any record of the subject, saw with certainty the identical object
that created so much conimotion among them. lIe applied
