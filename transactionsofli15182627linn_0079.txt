group with five joints to each of the tarsi among Tetramera, and
another with four joints among the Trimera, I clearly give them
a false description as well as an erroneous name.

It requires little observation to perceive that Aristotle’s group
of Ptilota 15 typically pentamerous, or, in other words, that it
has in its most normal forms five joints to the tarsus. Aberrant
exceptions there are, however, 10 all rules of this kind ; and, 115
we have seen above, the arrangement of Coleoptera given hythe
French school of naturalists is grounded on such exceptions.
Observations universally adopted as accurate, and judged of suf-
ficient importance to form the basis of a system, are not likely
to be viewed with suspicion by young naturalists. While,
therefore, on entering upon the science, Ι perceived that the
tarsal system was at utter variance with natural affinities, Ι
made no doubt of the statements upon which it was founded
being in the main correct. It was certainly evident, 115 shown
above, that this system, as propounded by the French entomolo-
gists, would not contain all Coleoptera; and, on the other hand,
that Illiger and Reichenbach had even exploded the section of
Dtmera,· but no one carried his scepticism 50 far as 10 express
doubts of a Linnean Cerambyoe and Curculio being different from
a carabus in being tetramerous, or of aCoccinella being properly
separated from a Chrysomela in being trimerous. The study of
natural affinitieS, however, is of that admirable nature, 111111,
