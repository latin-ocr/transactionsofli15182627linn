m August. Effice, upon lifting the Bearded Eagle which he
shot in Abyssinia‚ found himself covered with a yellowish dustz
the pluniage of the. bird being tawny. The flesh of the Heron is
much admired by some persons. The legs have sometimes a
rank fishy taste⁷ though the other parts of the bird are well-
fla νου red.

2. A. Egretta (Great White Heron).

On the 3rd of October last, in a wall< on the banks of the
river Stour, we observed a large white Heron cross over from
the Suffolk to the Essex side of the river. lt appeared to be
pure white, and to stand up rather taller than some Connnon
Herons which were feeding not far off. A similar bird was
observed in the spring on the Oakley shores ; and, subsequently
to our observatiom one was seen on the banks of the river Or-
well.

3. A. Nycticora (Night Heron).

Mr. Stagg of Yarmouth shot a Night Heron upon a tree in
his nursery. And we are informed by Mr. Hunt, that the spe-
cimen of this bird in his possession was shot in Suffolk, and kept
alive some time, being only slightly wounded. Another bird of
the same species was killed at Mr. Coke’s in the winter of 1819„
and is now in the possession of the Rev. George Glover.

4. A. stellaris (Bittern).

Some of the marshes of Norfolk afford a breeding-place to
the Bittern, whence we have received its egg, both ends of
which are nearly of the same shape. Pennant has justly re-
marked that this bird has a double iris. In one which we
examinech that next the pupil was reddish-yellow, the outer one
hazel. There was also a notch at the extremity of the upper

mandible z
