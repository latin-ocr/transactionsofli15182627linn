382 ΜΓ. YARRELL on the Troe-hece of Bircls.

but in a male and female of the same age, the greater depth of
insertion may occur in the male, as stated in Dr. Latham’s
paper. The furcula and bronchia also of the Common Crane
exactly resemble those of the Demoiselle and Stanley Crane, as
might be expected in birds so nearly allied. Before quitting
the subject of the Anthropoi'des Stcmleyamts, it is necessary I
should state, that this very rare bird passed when dead into
the possession of Mr. Leadbeater, to whose liberality I am in—
debted for the opportunity afforded nie of preparing and figuring
partos the bones, and to whom Ι with pleasure acknowledge
my obligations for many other interesting objects of investi-
gation. The Indian Crane, Ardea Antigone of Linneus, has the
same form of trachea and sternum as the Common Crane of
Europe, Ardea Grus.

The Black Swan of New Holland‚ the Anas Ati-ata of Lin-
noeus and others, gives me an opportunity of showing a structure
intermediate between the two most admired species of the genus
Cygnus of Cuvier, the common mute Swan, the stately orna-
ment of our lakes and rivers, and our more scarce winter visitor
the Hooper.

In the Black Swan the trachea quits the neck at the bottom,
and descends to the eentre circulor portion of the furcula, to
which bone it is firmly bound by a. tough membrane: the re-
maining portion then rises over the front of the breast bone
between the clavicles, and passes backward to the lungs‚ the
last portion of the tube immediately preceding the bone of
divarication being flattened horizontally. The form of the tra-
chea in our common Swan, in which it follows the neck without
deviation, being remembered, and Dr. Latham’s figure of the
wild Swan referred to, it will be observed, that the Black Swan
exhibits an interesting link between the two, and has not, that l
um aware, been either described or figured.
