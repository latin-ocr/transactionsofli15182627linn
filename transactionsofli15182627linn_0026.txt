Shrike, like those of many other birds, are subject to some va-
riation. The ground of them is sometimes blueish-white, 501116-
1111165 yellowish-white, and the spots are much larger and more
numerous upon some than upon others. The beak of one of
these birds which we shot, was coated over with cmv-dung,
(10111111655 from its having been searching therein for insects.
We once saw a male Red-backed Shrike eager in chase of 11
Blackbird. We have heard a bird of this kind exactly imitate
the cry of a young Owl ς but are at a loss to conjecture its 011-
ject, as it cannot be supposed to have done so with a view ot*
‹lecoying birds of that sort within its reach.

Genus X. MUsCICAPA.

1. M. Grisola (Spotted Flycatcher, wall-bird).

The plumage of 1116 young is very different from that of the
old birds, being all over spotted.

'Phe form of the Spotted Flycatcher is altogether adapted for
activity of wing ε 115 legs are very short ; its breast broad : 1116
bird narrows rapidly from breast to tail: and it has great length
of wing in proportion 10 115 size.

A Spotted Flycatcher was once observed by us to alight upon
a rail with a large white butterfiy in its 111011111, which it swallowed
whole, wings 115 well as body 2 whereas a tame Bmmbling, which
has often butterflies given 10 it, uniformly rejects the wings.
Having one evening let fly a large specimen of the Lucanus
Cervus, it was immediately caught by a Spotted Flycatcher.
This bird is known in Norfolk and Suffolk by the name of Wall-
bird, from the circumstance of its frequently making its nest in

a tree against 11 wall.
2. M. albicollis (Pied Flycatcher).

We have seen a specimen of this bird, which was killed near

Cromer.
