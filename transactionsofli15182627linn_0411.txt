Mr. YARRELL οη tlte Traclzcoe of Bircls. 381

notice of this new and interesting species should have been fur-
nished by a gentleman so eminently distinguished for his acquire-
ments as a naturalist and a scholar. Possessing as this bird does in
a great degree the external characters of the Demoiselle, it also
bears some resemblance to it in its anatomical structure. The
trachea, quitting the direction of the vertebrae of the neck at the
lower part, passes downward and backward between the branches
of the furcula till it reaches the anterior edge of the keel ; it then
turns upward into a groove formed for its reception‚ and being
suddenly reflected forward and downward, traversos the project-
ing portion of the sternum, and passes backward to the lungs, as
shown in the annexed representation. The furcula, it will be
observed, is similar to that of the Demoiselle.

Dr. Latham’s figure of the sternum and trachea of the 00111-
111011 Crane (Ardea Grus) being referred to, and compared with
the same parts in the Demoiselle and the Stanley Crane, it will
be perceived, that the insertion of the windpipe in the latter bird
is upward, that of the Demoiselle principally backward, while
that of the Common Crane will be found 10 be a compound of
both, combining the upward inclination of the one with the
backward insertion of the other; and the depth of this insertion
within the keel appears to depend on the age of the bird rather
than the sex. In a very old female, of which I prepared the
bones, the insertion is carried to the utmost extent that the size
of the sternum will admit. In a second specimen of a younger
male bird, the insertion was not so deep as in that last men-
tioned, but still much more so than in the sternum represented
by Dr. Latham : and in the valuable and extensive collection of
ι10511110 Brookes‚ Esq.‚ 10 which that gentleman very lx’indly
allows me acceSS, there is a skeleton of the Common Omne,—
evidently a young bird by the state of the bones‚—in which the

insertion is not carried so far as in the representation alluded to :
