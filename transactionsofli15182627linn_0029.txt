was killed upon the nest. The structure of this nest resembled
that described by Montagu, but the eggs were different from
those found by him. They were white, with numerous small
purplish-red spots. The nest was artfully concealed‚ having
the long grass drawn over the top ; and a hole was made in the
graSS, as if cut with a pair of scissors, forming a path for the
bird to escape. Two other birds of this species were killed at
the same time, and several others were heard. They were ob-
served to frequent that partos the wood where the grass was
high and the trees low.

2. S. Plzragmites (Sedge Warbler, Reed-bird).

The legs and feet of the Sedge NVarbler are remarkably large
in proportion to the size of the body ; the bill is also larger than
is usual in birds of this genus. The disproportion of these parts
has been noticed by Ray and White, but seems not to have been
remarked by other authors. In a specimen which we killed, the
legs as far as the toes were covered with an epidermis,which might
easily have been pulled off. The under partos the toes is yellow.
The base of the hind toe very stout and broad, doubtless to give
it a firm grasp, the bird living chiefly in sedges and bushes
hanging over the water. The wings are very short, compared
with the length of the body. Its shape is altogether well calcu-
lated for making its way through the close coverts which it fre-
quents. The Sedge XVarbler will sometimes begin its song
exactly like that of the Swallow; it will fly into the air singing,
and come down with its wings turned up in the manner of the
Lesser Field Lnrk, which may perhaps account for its having
been called Willow Lark.

The Reed NVren frequents the reeds in the river Gipping, and
