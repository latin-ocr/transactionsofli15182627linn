mals set at naught all our classilication by their osteology and
mode of bringing forth.

The adoption of these numerous terms, intended to express
fixed ideas, must be looked on with suspicion. The terms
species and genus are too well established by custom, and are
so clearly the result of convenience, and moreover conform so
closely to the ordinary use of these words, that their utility
cannot be questioned 3 but those numerous subdivisions current
among our neighbom'S, and sensibly increasing among ourselves,
may well be doubted as unphilosophical language. To each of
them is attempted to be assigned a definite value beforehand,
and an impracticable degree of precisi0n3 and we deceive our-
selves by fancying that we can deal with these delicate and
fleeting instruments of thought differently from the rest of the
world. But are we to attempt to fetter nature by our systems
and ternis ¹? ‘⁶ Books should follow sciences, not sciences books,’'
says the immortal Bacon; yet the adoption of systems and
technical expressions, which have received their definition be-
forehand, cannot be employed without the danger ofperpetuating
false hy potlieseS, and an apprehension on the part of the ignorant,
that these inventions give us some power over nature not be-
longing to ordinary language.

The more correct mode would be to exclude from the natural
method most of these terms, and to employ in their place some
convertible words of looser import, as indeed M. Cuvier has to
some extent done; such for instance, as group, section, division,
to express those larger assemblages of approximations to as-
signed forms, which are rather predicated than proved; and in
many cases to point them out by mere signs, such as are used
in printing. Thus, for instance, the word section, or any similar
word, might be employed to express the plants severally com-

prehended in the order Gramineae, the class Compos-itae, and the
