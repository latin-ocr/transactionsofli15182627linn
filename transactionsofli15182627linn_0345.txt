A ustrolian Bircls in the Collection osllee Linnean Society. 329

Pedes subfortes, subelongati; acrotarsiis scutellatis, paratursiis
integris.

This form offers one of the greatest difficulties to the inves-
tigator of affinities. The birds that exhibit it are said to be
Iloney-Eaters. This we much doubt. They are found among
the fiowers of the Eucalgspti; but this circumstance may arise as
well from their being in search of the insects abounding in these
flowers, as os the honey contained in them. It is strange that
we have never been able to examine a tongue of these birds,
although the skins are common. Their general appearance
indicates much of the Shrilse. The strong bristles of the rictas
suggest. the idea of their food being animal, and indeed originally
induced Dr. Latham to place them with the Linnean sslmcicapoe.
The integrity of the margins of the bill, on the other hand, seems
to militate against this supposition. The extreme shortness and
roundness of the wing again, and the long and graduated tail,
are additional characters that demand consideration. In these
characters, as well as in the length and softness of the feathers
011 the back, they approach the long-tailed American leamno-
phili. On the whole these birds form an interesting object of
research to the naturalist, who may have the opportunity of de-
termining their exact station in the Order, by observation of
their habits and characters in their native country. Until these
points are ascertained, we leave them at the extremity of this
family, to which they are usually referred.
