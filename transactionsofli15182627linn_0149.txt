this quality. I am inclined, however, to doubt the accuracy of
their information; and the tree in other respects so nearly
resembles the Pet-alu as to justify its being considered as the
wild plant of the same species. In 1800· Ι gave specimens and
a drawing to Sir J. E. Smith under the name of Ficus Gonia,
and shall here give a description.

Fructus geminus, sessilis, bractea triphylla cinctus, laevis, magni-

The plant of RumphiuS‚ mentioned with doubt among the
synonyma, is very like indeed to what l consider as the Ficus
citrisolia; and the strong resemblance which this has both to
the Sapo and Pet-alu, both certainly emitting roots from their
branches, induces me to doubt the information on this point
which I received from the natives. I have however seen a 1166
