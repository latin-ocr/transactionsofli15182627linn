are black and bare, the latter smooth, the former slightly rough
and granular. The eyes are rather large, the irides very dark
brown, and the pupils vertical‚ sometimes linear, sometimes
oval. The ears are about four inches apart, pointed, usually
erect, moderately long, and covered outside with a little fine
reddish-white down, inside with the same, and the meatus amli—
torius extimus partially crossed by a tuft of white hair, which
descends from the inside of the superior margin of the external
ear.

The chin and sides of the under lip are blackish: the begin-
ning of the throat a deep black 3 and these two hues are separated
from each other, more or less completely, by a transverse oblique
band or white blotch. On the sorehead, immediately over the
inner angle of each eye, are a few particularly long black hairs,
and some similar ones are observed about two 'inches behind the
organs just mentioned, only, however, rather a little below their
level. The latter issue from a thimble-like cavity formed by
the shorter hairs receding from each other, and another and a
similar appearance, nay even if any thing more distinct, occurs
about an inch behind the corner of the mouth, from which also
protrudes a small number oflike black stiffhairs. The whiskers
are long, very strong, black, and disposed in three or four rows
on the sides of the upper lip a little behind the nostrils. The
hair on the neck and body is very long and shaggy, measuring
in many places, but particularly about the sides and back, at
least six inches. On the lateral parts of the neck, from the
temples to the anterior edge of the shoulders, the whole is of a
dirty tawny-white or dirty-yellow, which, with a little more
white, is nearly the colour of the breast, belly, and insides of
the extremities. Along the upper part of the neck, commencing
at the forehead, the hairs are rather longer than on the sides,
and of a tawny-white colour, slightly varied, however, by a
