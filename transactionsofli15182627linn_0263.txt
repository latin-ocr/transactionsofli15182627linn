tially in the air this member becomes of much importance, as
contributing more or less to their support or government in their
a'erial movements. In the true M uscicapa its general character
is that of being slightly forked: in the present group it is
rounded at the apere ; but what it loses in that forked structure,
which is generally supposed to be most conducive to the pur-
poses of flight, it gains in being lengthened and capable of being
spread out like a fan, so as to give the bird a greater power in
the air. The group is also distinguished by the great length
and number of the rictal bristles, which exceed the bill itself in
length. This also is an important character among the birds
that feed on insects in the air, as serving to encompass and
secure their prey: and the greater or less developement of the
character becomes a material point of distinction among them.
The wings, although very similar in structure to those of M usci-
capa, are less rounded, and, being in a slight degree acumi—
nated, possess perhaps somewhat superior powers of flight. We
have not hitherto noticed any birds possessing the characters of
the group, except the New Holland species.

The figure that Dr. Latham gives of this species has much
more white on the latera] tail-feathers than our bird. But that
gentleman affirms that the species is subJect to much variation.
M1·.Caley thus observes on the manners of this bird. “Fan-
tait—There is something singular in the habits of this bird. It
frequents the small trees and bushes, from whence it suddenly

darts at its prey, spreading out its tail like a fan, and to appear-
