South wales. I never observed it to attack the fowls: and I
have some recollection of the natives telling me its principal
food was field-mice. I have seen it at times hover in the air

The Elauus melanopterus appears to be spread over a vast
extent of the Old World, being numerous in Egypt, and the
greater part of Africa, as far as to the Cape ofGood Hope. It has
also been met with in various parts of India, in Jam, and New
Holland. There seems to be a considerable variation in the
plumage of this species, the black markings of the wing spread-
ing to a greater or less extent in different specimens.
