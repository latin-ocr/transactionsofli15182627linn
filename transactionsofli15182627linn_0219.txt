out of the genus Ampelis, Linn., and some conterminous birds.
He however still assignedit a station in the series of his genera,
immediately subsequent to the Linnean genus Coracias. The
bird evidently exhibits strong relations to both these groupS. In
its colours, its size and strength, and its general form, it bears 3
resemblance to the Rollers ; while in the wide gape of the bill
it equally seems to approach the broad-billed Berty-eaters.
J udging, however, even from external characters, we have no
hesitation in stating our opinion, that these relations are merely
analogical, and that the natural station of the bird is in the
tribe of Fissirostres, but at that extremity of the 8101111 1111010 it

which point out its affinity to the Fissirostral group, whose per-
fection consists in their powers of ssight, and of inclosing their
prey within their gape as they pursue it on the wing. The
brilliant colours of this bird, which have hitherto led to its being
placed among the Rollers, equally associate it with the present
family of Tocliclce and with the neighbouring Halcyoniclce: while
the bill appears decidedly formed according to the same model
as that of Eurylaimus* and the conterminous group of Podar-gas.
W e had much pleasure in finding that our conjectures respectin g
the affinities of this group, which we had drawn merely from its
external characters, were confirmed by the accounts of its habits
and mode of life, which we have extracted above from Mr. Ca-
ley’s manuscripts. We 1111151 observe in addition, that this natu-
