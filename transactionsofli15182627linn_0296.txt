“This species‚” says Mr. Caley‚ “is called by the natives
Dulang' and J11la11g'. Like the King’s Pam—ot (Pl. scapulatus),
it is found in large flocks among the ripe Indian corn, both
species being intermixed. It varies much in colour: but as the
greater part of the fiock is of the colour of the female, it may
almost. be taken sor granted that they are young birds—The
*iatives tell me it makes its nest chiefly in the Peppcrntint—lree
'Em-alffinus pilu-rita), always in the body, but, never in the
Doughs. Sometimes it enlarges the hole through which it
enters. Year after year the same place is frequented for the
purposes of incubation. lt makes no nest but from the deeayed
parts of the tree. It has four young ones. 'l'he eggs are white.

‘⁶ I have met with this bird in November in the most moun-

tainous parts of the country: but l apprehend it leaves these
parts in the winter.”
