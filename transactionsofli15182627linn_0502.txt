4513 Mr. BLACKWALL's Observations to ascerlain

usual horizonta] position into one almost perpendicular, they
emitted from their spinning-apparatus a small quantity of the
glutinous secretion with which they construet their webs. This
viscous substance being drawn out by the ascending current of
rarefied air into fine lines several feet in length, was carried
upward, until the spiders feeling themselves acted upon with
sufficient force in that direction, quitted their hold of the objects
on which they stood, and cominenced their journey by mount-
ing alost.

Whenever the lines became inadequate to the purpose for
which they were intended, by adhering to any fixed body, they
were immediately detached froin the spinners, and so converted
into terrestrial gossanier by means of the last pair of legs, and
the proceedings just described were repeated; which plainly
proves that these operations result from a strong desire felt by
the insects to effect an ascent. But what, it may be asked, is
the exciting cause of this singular propensity'? It has been
suggested that hunger, or an inclination to procure some fa-
vourite kind of food, may supply the requisite stimulus. These
suppositions, however, are discountenanced by the plump ap-
pearance which the animals exhibit3 by their total disregard
of such winged insects as happen to be placed within their
power; by their utter inability to regulate their motions, while
afioat, in any other manner than by letting out or drawing in the
lines by which they are conveyed through the air, and thus pro-
moting their ascent or descent: by the unsuitableness of the
lines for securing their prey; and lastly, by the uncertainty
when a favourable day for their purpose may occur, or even
that one may occur at all.

XVere I to hazard a conjecture on the subject, Ι should be
disposed to attribute the manifest anxiety of these insects to

change
