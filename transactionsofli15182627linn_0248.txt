a strongly distinguishing character. The illotacilla Africana,
Gmel., Le Fluteur of M. Le Yaillant, belongs to this group.
In that bird the frontal bristles are not so long as as in our bird,
but they are more numerous, and equally strong. We do not
feel quite satisfied as to the situation of the group. We have
some grounds for thinking that with Timalia it may rather be
referred to that place among the Tliruslzes where the species
gradually pass into the ῙΓανὸίεν-ς, than to the present situation.
At the sanie time, it shows some resemblance to Megalia-us,
llorsf., and perhaps to Malui-as, Vieill.: in which last genus
M. Teinininck would decidedly place it according to the mode
in which he has undertaken to enlarge that group. U'e wait for
further knowledge of the habits of the species to enable us to
determine this point.

This bird Mr. Cale)v procured in a scrubby place on the north
side of Paramatta. He was able to ascertain nothing of its
habits. He calls it in his notes ‘⁶ Bristle Eira?
