Yar'ro-trees (a species of Eucalyptus)‚ using only the vegetable

²³³³ This bird, together with live other new species 01 Parrots belonging to the
sonet-5³5 collection, were described by M. Teniminck in 1116 13111 volume of 111656
Transactions. The same birds, and from the sanie collection, 501116 of them being
found exclusively in it, were also described by the late M. Kuhl in a Monograph of
the family published in the “ Nava Assa Plinzssico-Illcdica Academia (bimarem Leopol-
(lino-Carolina‘ Natum? ‹·111·iosorum,⁷' but described under different names from those of
M. Temminck. A question here anses as to the respective right of these naturalists
to have their names adopted. On the point of 11110111)ν 1116 case 15 as follows. M. Tem-
mmck's Paper was published in 1521 : M. Kuhl's bears the date of 1820. But on
the other hand, M. Temminck's Paper was read before the 306161)- 011 1116 2151 01 De-
cember imo—For our own parts, we have not the slightest hesitation in preferring
the names of M. Teniniinck. U⁷e do not found our decision 011 1116 11166 point of the
act of reading before a chartered Society being to be considered as an act of publica-
tion3 a point, however, which ought to be determined and acted upon as of much
consequence to the 1111616515 01 naturalists: but xve go upon the broad principle, that
when a naturalist has the exclusive authority to describe any subject-2. of Natural
1115111111, and has devoted himself to the task,—a fact of course to be ascertained from
the public reading of his Paper,-—any attempt to anticipate him in his descriptions,
bv taking advantage of the delays which sometimes unavoidably take place in the
publication of extensive works, 15 perfectly unwarrantabst, and ought decidedly 10
be discountenanced. Such are our views as 10 1116 general principle. 111 applying
it to the present case, however, we 1111151 subjoin our suspicions that 501116 1111511116
arose between those two gentlemen. M. Kuhl was 1116Ι friend and coadjutor of
M. Temrninck during his visit to this country when he described the birds in ques-
tiom and it 15 not probable that he would have interfercd, unless under 501116 111156011-
ception.
