qftlze Nor-folle and Szffolk Birds. 13

Genus IX. LANIUS.

1. L. Eoecuhitor (Great Cinereous Shrike).

The migrations of this species are uncertain. It has been
killed in Suffolk in the months of January, April, May, and
September. And on the 9th of July 1810 we saw a female
Cinereous Shrike at Baytham in that county, which made a
noise like that of a pair of shears clipping a fence. We are
informed by the Rev. George Reading Leathes, that this bird
has been frequently seen in the Hyde near Bury (a large wood
on the estate of Sir Thomas Gage), and that he has received a
specimen shot there. In the autumn of 1819 four of these birds
were sent to Mr. Hunt, which had been killed in Norsolk. Early
in December 1819 a Cinereous Shrike frequented a thick thorn
hedge, near Mr. Hoy’s house at Higham, 11111 was so shy that it
could not be approached within gun-shot. On examining the
hedge Mr. Hoy found three frogs, and as many mice, spittecl 011
1119 thorns. He therefore set six very small 51991 traps, each
baited with a mouse. On the following day two of the traps
were found sprung, and the baits gone. By watching in con-
cealment Mr. 11. 50011 afterwards observed the Shrike to dart
down upon 11 111111, and rise perpendicularly‚ but not quick
enough to escape, as it was caught by two of its toes. The bird
was carried alive to the house, and placed in a room in which 11
thorn 1111511 was fixed, and some inice given to it: one of which
it was observed through a 11019 10 spit upon a thorn with the
greatest quickness and adroitness.

2. L. Collurio (Red-backed Shrike).

A nest of this bird, built at Offt0n‚ was composed of dried
grass and green moss, with a few small twigs of the Clcmatls

vitalba, and lined with fibres. The eggs of the Red-backcd
Shrike,
