Genus LI. Tu Ι NG A.

1. T. subm-quara (Pigmy Curlew).

Several of these birds have been killed at Yarmouth in the
autumn. One of them, which was shot at that place in the
month of August, had a red breast, and was in plumage similar
to the one in a summer dress preserved in the British Museum.
W'e have met with this species on Pewit Island. It is more
solitary than the Dunlin, not more than a pair being seen to-
gether; and is a stupid bird, suffering a boat to approach close
to it. The legs of this bird when fresh killed are of a pale-green,
but when dried they appear black.

2. Τ. variabilis (Dunlin, Sea-Snipe, Stint).

Very large flocks of Dunlins are sometimes seen on the east-
ern coast of the kingdom.

3. T. maritima (Purple Sandpiper).

A few of these birds have been killed at Yarmouth. We once
observed a Sandpiper, which appeared to belong to this species,
tlying along the shore of the Stour, hovering like a bird of prey⁷
and continually darting down close to the ooze.

4. T. minuta (Little Sandpiper).

We have received this bird from Yarmouth, and also killed it
on Ray Island in the river Stour.

5. T. cinerea (Knot).

In spring the Knot visits the coasts of this part of the king-
dom, on its way to the North to breed3 and again makes its
appearance on its return, sometimes as early as the month of

August; but the principal fiocks arrive later in autumn, and a
