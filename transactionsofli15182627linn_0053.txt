mandible ; and both mandibles, nearly half-way along the edges
(reckoning from their tips)‚ are furnished with a beautiful and
regular serratum, the points of which stand inward, and are so
tine as almost to require a magnifying-glass to distinguish them.
This structure must be of great service to the bird in securing
its prey.

Genus XLVII. RECU RVIROSTRA.

1. R. Avocetta (Avoset‚ Shoeing—horn).

During the breeding season the⁴Avoset used to frequent the
marshes at VVinterton : and in the summer of 1816 we saw one
there which had young. This bird made several circles round
us, uttering a shrill note, and then alighted in the middle of a
pool of water, on which it fioated; then took several turns on
wing, and again alighted on the water, where it sat motionless. ι
The bill of the Avoset is so flexible that it is totally unfit for
a weapon of offence‚ and the bird itself has a peculiarly harm-
less and meek appearance.

Genus XLVIII. PLATALEA.
