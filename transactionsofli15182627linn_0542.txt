490 Mr. 13101111Νο on Systems ancl Metlzocls

This attempt at breaking down good orders and genera into
many subordinate and loosely defined groups, and encumbering
them with names, involves the subject in obscurity, and may well
be questioned as contrary to his main design of presenting those
comprehensive views which are afforded by a natural system.

Mr. Brown has adopted a different mode in his “ Proclromus.”
He has attempted to combine no further than his knowledge
would warrant, not even employing the terms class or order as
the names of his groups. As his object is chiefly syntllesiS‚ he
keeps his diagnostic characters apart, thus leaving the mind less
embarrassed when it is in pursuit of analysis. It must be ad-
mitted indeed, that his work cannot be employed with any suc-
cess by the inexperienced, or even by those who have occupied
themselves only in searching for species; but to have made it
subservient to this purpose, would have been to have rendered
it less beautiful and complete as a work of synthesis. His apho-
risms and remarks not being reduced to exact method, “ are‚” as
Lord Baeon expresses it, ‘⁶ still in their growth, increasing in
bulk and substance.”

Now wherev‘er the object of the systematist is to enable his
reader to discover speeieS‚ it is necessary to detine at every step;
and where natural characters do notpresent themselves, we must
adopt artifici-al ones. For this purpose large classes are formed,
many of which are necessarily artiticial. These again are broken
up into orders, mostly of an artificial character3 and thus the
naturalist is led step by step from more comprehensive definitions
to less, from class to order, from order to genus, and from genus
to species. ln this descending series it will be observed that
the essential feature is the facility that is afforded for definition.
Hence the Linnaean system of botany has succeeded so well, be-
