:318 Jlsr.v1oons’s and Dr. HORSFIELD'S Description of tlte

One of the specimens of this species in the collection was
brought by Mr. Brown from Port J ackson, where he met with
it in August 1803. The species comes very near the first sub-
division of this genus, having a stronger bill, and rather more,
elongated toes than the birds of the present Section. The shape
of its tail however, which is even, retains it in its present situa-
tion, but at that extreme of the section which joins the first sub-
division, and completes the circular succession of the whole
group.

This species bears some resemblance to M.Vieillot’s Heorotairc
brun (pl. (35), the Cer-thia fusca, Gmel.; but it is differently
marked on the throat and lower body; and as it belongs to a
different locality it may be considered distinct.

This group approaches very nearly to the shorter- and stronger-
billed birds of .Mellplzaga‚ such as M. auricomis, Lath. ; but the
bill is considerably stouter at the base and less arcuated. The
nares also are not so linear, but become slightly oval towards
the anterior part. The space round the eye is naked. We are
assured that the tongue of the first species is bristly towards the
