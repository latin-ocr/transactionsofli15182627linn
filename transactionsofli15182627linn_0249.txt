We feel much uncertainty respectin g the natural station of 11115
genus of M. Vieillot. That gentleman places 11 111 1110 same
division with the Thraslzes, next to his genus Psaroiclas (Pastor,
Temni.) ; and from the size of the typical species and its general
appearance, such a situation may be assigned it with much pro-
bability of being near the truth. 0111 specimem, both of this
species and of the next, which seems to belong to the same
group, are not in sufficiently good condition to enable us to
come to any decided opinion on this point. But as far as we
can judge from the general characters of the bird before 115, 11
51111105 115 that it bears a very great resemblance to the group of
Enicaras, Το111111., which belongs to the neighbouring Island of
Java, and which is closely allied to the true Motacilla or the
Wagtails of Authors. The length of the legs, the depression of
the bill, and the general disposition of the 00101115, afford us some
grounds for such a supposition. We leave it in 11115 place pro-
visionally for the present, until more perfect specimens are
before 115, 111111 501110 knowledge of the habits and anatomy of
the birds points out with certainty their station in nature.

Our specimen was procured by Mr. Brown at Port Jackson
in 1802.
