10 116 described would ere this have been familiar to naturalistsL
and the illustrious Cuvier saved the necessity of making the fol-
lowing confession regarding one of them'ss. “ Nous avons au
cabinet du roi une hyene dont la patrie est inconnue, sur laquelle
je suis en doute si c’est encore une variete de l'hyene ray(=e ou
bien si 011 (1011 111 regarder comme. une espece distinet.”

Two species of the genus Hyaena inhabit the more southern
parts of Africa, viz. the Hycena emerita, or Tiger Wolf of the
Cape 6010111515, and the Strand Wolf of the same, or the animal
evidently alluded to by Cuvier in the remarks above quoted.
The description of the latter has been drawn up from observa-
tions made on several different specimenS, but particularly on
one which was purchased for the South African Museum, when
very young, and which now full-grown still continues in the
possession of that establishment.

The other animal, as will be seen, is a new species of Hymni,
which, though it has lately been sent 10 Europe, has not yet, as
far as Ι know, been named or described. From its being always
found living in cavities or hollows of old decayed trees, I have
given it the specific appellation of “ar-boreus.” The drawing 01
1116 Hyaena accompanying this paper, is a close and faithful re—
presentation of the animal; and it was my wish to have. sent
one also of the Hyraoe, but in that I have been disappointed, in
consequence of my specimen dying before the drawing could
be made.

Hmzm VILLOSA.
Hyaena with the body dusky-gray variegated by large black
spots or oblique bands, with the neck yellowish, and the
extremities marked by interrupted transverse black lines.
