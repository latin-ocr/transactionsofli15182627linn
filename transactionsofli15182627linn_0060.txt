2. G. Porzana (Spotted Gallinule).

There can be no doubt that the Spotted Gallinule breeds in
the marshes of Norfolk. We have seen a considerable number
of its eggs at Yarmouth, which, as well as its young, were found
in the neighbourhood of that place. And we are also in pos-
session of an egg taken from a female of this species which was
killed in the marshes below Norwich.

3. G. ssaillonii (Baillon's Gallinule).

We have met with a specimen of this bird in the collection os
Mr. Crickmore of Beccles, which was shot near that town. The
throat, neck and belly are asli-colour; the sides and under 1311-
coverts barred and spotted with black and white. The back
is like that of the Spotted Gallinule; but this bird is con-
siderably smaller than that species. An extremely small Galli-
nule, probably of the above kind, was shot at Nacton in
Suffolk many years since, and was in the possession of the late
John Vernon, Esq.

4. G. Clzloropus (Common Gallinule).

The Common Gallinule frequently roosts on trees. Two young
birds of this species, which were hatched by Mr. Youell under
3 11011, used 10 13κο their food from the bill of their foster-mother:
and it was not till they were several weeks old that they would
pick their food from the ground. ure have notwithstanding
observed this bird in its natural state, when 11 had only been
hatched a few days, running about upon the tops of the weeds
and picking insects from them.
