flight, moreover, are so great, that we need not be surprised at
finding that even the same species will sometimes spread itself
over the most distant regionS. Such at least appears to be 1116
fact, whatever may be the causes which produce it. An analo-
gous fact is observable in the Grallatorial order, where the same
consideration&⁸ added to the habits of lnigration common to the
order, may probably account for a similar law of distribution.
Among the Natatores also we may expect that the extensive
powers of locomotion found in some of the groups of the order,
suited as well to the water as to the air, may tend to their wide
dispersion. A few instanees consequently occur of an accord-
ance between the birds we are about to describe, and some of
the forins of the above-mentioned groups which are familiar to
Europeans. But by far the greater portion of the groups of
New Holland will be observed to exhibit peculiarities contined
to their own neighbourhood.

ἕ lVere we to follow a practice which 11115 become very general among modern
naturalists, we should alter the specific name of the above bird, in consequence of its
being derived from a local source. We consider this practice, however, although
sanctioncd by high authority, to be altogether founded in error. In giving local nantes,
it is not inferred that the species is found only in the country which assords tho deno-
mination3 much less that it is the only speeies of the group found there. All that 15
inferred is, that it does actually belong to the country. After all, names are of use
only as they tend to point out the subjecte sor which they stand. And a name long
established, although perhaps not the most appropriate, generally becomes 50 iden-
tified with the species 115 10 call it to mind with greater precision than any new name,
however significant. Few names indeed, however well chosen, can be exclusively
appropriate to specie53 and a considerable ntunber,—sucli as names intended to pay a
