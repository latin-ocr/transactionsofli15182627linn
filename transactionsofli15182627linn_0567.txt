A human Skull, aecompanied by the following Com-
munication, was presented from Dr. Harlan, of Phila-
delphia.—“ This skull is supposed to have belonged to
an extinct race of Indians, which existed anterior to the
present natives of the soil. This is inserred not only
from some marked differences in the Skulls observed 011
compar-ison with those of our modern Indians, but also
from the peculiarities of the utensils, both of war and
cooking, found with the Skeletons, and which resemble
more those of the South Americans or East Indians.

‘⁶ There are several saltpetre caves in Kentucky, but
that from whence this Skull comes (Golconda) con-
tains the most extensive remains, several cart-loads
having been turned out, which are left mouldering on
the soil. Occasionally whole munimies are found, pre-
served from decay by the atmosphere being strongly
impregnated with nitre.”
