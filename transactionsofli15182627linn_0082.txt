70 Mon W. S. MACLEAY on the Strzcctzzre of tlte Tarsus

three very natural groups is, that it consists of five articuhrtions,
ofwhich the three first are dilated into cushions, the third being
bilobed, while the two last are filiform, the fourth being very
small. But if these insects be thus pentamerous‘ffi our attention
will naturally be turned to the Trimera of the French school.
May not they also have erroneously been described? Latreille‚ in
characterizing the well-known genus Coccinella in Deterville's
Dictionnaire cl’Histoire Natio-elle, says, “Trois articles aux tarses
dont les deux premiers en coeur et garni des brosses.’' Yet on
examining the Coccinella lss-maculata of Java, we clearly see
that it is at least tetramerous, the two first joints of the tarsus
being dilated, and the two last filiform. De Geer has even given
a correct magnified figure of a similar structure of the tarsus in

ᾗ* On this paper being read before the Linnean society, a short notice of its general
purport appeared in the Plzilosoplzical sslagazine for February last3 and Mr. Kirby
having seen this notice, stated in the following number that he was aware of the facts
given to the public in my paper. To this effect he quoted a passage from the forth-
coming third volume of his Introduction to Entonzology. Howeoer, in a subsequent
communication inserted in the Plzilosoplzical Magazine for April, and intended to cor-
rect sorne mistakes of the former communication, Mr. Kirby, in speaking of the joint of
the tarsus in Corcinella figured by De Geer, but certainly not understood by that great
naturalist‚ says, “ He (i. e. De Geer) regarded thisjoint not as a primary butas a secon-
dary joint, or the joint of ajoint‚ as l am disposed to (lo myself, and therefore, in the
Introduction to Entomology, and upon other occasions, Ι speak of the Chrysomelida‘, &a
as tetmmerous, and the Coccinellidae as trinierous.'' As Mr. Kirby thus continues to
consider the Clzrysomelida’, &c as ten-amemus, and the Coscinellidoe as tumemus, and
has thus abandoned all claim to that generalization upon which the whole use and
merit of this discovery, as I conceive, hinges, I have only to say, that Ι have not been
able to discover with him that Cassida has the same kind of tarsus as Cermnbyoe or
(s'lnysomeln. In the above-mentioned passage, cited from the forthcoming volume of
the Introduction to Entotnology, Mr. Kirby says, that in the Linnean genera Curculio,
Ceranzhyii, Clnyoemela, Cassida, &a ‘⁴ the claw-joint consists of two articulations.''
Judging from the affinity of Cassida to Clnysomela, Ι thought so myself at first, but I
certainly have not been able to confirm this reasoning by observation.—]lIay 1825.
