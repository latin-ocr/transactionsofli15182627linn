140 Dr. FRANCIS IIAMILTON'S Commentargs

which the Teregam 15 quoted, applies very well in every thing
but the fruit to the plant which l take to be the Atti ,11667- Alone:
but 11115 again 15 quoted by M. Poiret (Eue. Melle. Sul). ii. (554.)
and by Dr. Roxburgh (Hert. 136113·- (jo.) for the ficus eacelsa.
No species under this name 15 111611110116(1 111 Willdenow3 yet it
15 possible, as the specific character agrees entirely with the
plant, that 11115 15 what he 611115 Picus septica (Sl). Pl. iv. 1142).
As for 11115 116 quotes neither the authorities adopted by Burman
(Fl. lml. ¹226), 1115 plant 15 probably different from Burman's.
Specimens of the plant that ] have 56611 are deposited in the
library at the India 1101156 (Cat. No. 2413).

This plant Burman (Fl. [ml. 9911.) joined with the Ficus septica
011111111ρ111115(11611). Αηιὸ. 111. 1513. uoti), which 11111116116 adopted ;
and the same 15 done by M. Lamarck (Eue. Mem. ii. 4901), both
no doubt following the authority os the elder Burman in the ex—
planation of the plates 111 1116 Πενίπινὶιιηι Amboinense.. This autho-
rity 15 110116 of the best ; and the form both of the leaves and fruit
in the figures given by the two authors 15 50 different, that 1
suspect they meant different plants. Willdenow was probably
of the 5111116 opinion, 115 116 quotes 116111161· for 1115 Ficus septica,
which 116 took from Forster, and 11111611, as I have said, 15 per-
haps the Atti Meet* Alea. l have not 56611 any plant which l
could refer 10 1116 Ilamlir ,111111 7,· but it 5661115 to have a very
considerable affinity to the meas 01›l›osil{fitlia of Ur. Roxburgli,
and some of 115 leaves are represented in the figure 115 having
nearly a similar position.
