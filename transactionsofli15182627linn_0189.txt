partially remodelling the terms of his nomenclature, that r ω
conceive ourselves strictly to derive our principles from hun.
We are willing to go even so much further as to assert that
those naturalists, who in the present advanced state os sci-
ence would have us bind ourselves exclusively to his nomen-
dature, virtually run counter to the spirit of his precepts. Hm!
he left us only what he called his ‘⁶ Syste1n‚'’ this fact mieht
not appear so evident. But he has left us what is even of more
value, if possible,—his opinion of that system, and of its insuf-
ficiency for any purpose but to meet the limited knowledge os
his age, Ile pointed out* to us how far it was a mere outline
of the material world, to be filled up as increasing insormation
would furnish the details‚—how far it was a mere substitute for
that more ample view of nature, of which succeeding ages might
hope to obtain a glimpse. He saw, in fact, the promised land

’ἒ We allude to those sketches os the vegetable kingdom, which, with the modi-st>
always attendant on true genius and infornmtion, Linnoeus styled “ Fragments uf ιι
Natural Method.’' In these the first glimpse is given of that improved modo of s) ni-
bolical representation by which we may hope, as knowledge increases, to communi-
cate with some degree of aecuracy our ideas respecting the groups of nature. The
deficiency perceptible in these “ Fragnients'’ is expressly stated to have originatcd
in the deficiency of matcrials, which more extensive knowledge would serve to sup-
ply3——“ defectus nondum delectorum in causst fuit quod methodus naturalis deficiat,
quam plurium cognitio perficiet3 natura enini non facit saltus.'’ (Phil. Bul.) Πο
cannot give a more just description of the genuine merits of Linnaeus with respect to
his views of arrangement, than hy transcribing the words of thc author of the “Hora
Entomologiccr,'' who, after stating that “he honours the inemory of that great nian,'' not
on accountof ‘⁴ liis precision of description,” nor of “ his learning in synonyms,” nor ot'
“ his having been a happy inventor of words,” asserts, “ that his glory is built on much
more stable foundations: for the man who first pointed out the distinction between tho
natural method and an artificial system 3 who first perceived the impossibility of giving
either accurate definitions or characters to natural groups; and who first remarked the
existence of interniediate genera between natural orders, must always be considevwl us
one of the principal founders ofour knowledge with respect to the natural system, when-
soever this shall appear.’'—Horae Eut. Pref. p. xx·
