The necessity of subdividing the overgrown Linnean genus of
Massicapa has long been acknowledged: and the difficulty of
seizing upon such characters as will serve to distinguish such
subdivisions has been equally admitted. Where so much simi-
larity prevails as in the characters belonging to all the species
of the truly natural group of Illa-scicapidcz‘, it is only by 011561111ηὲ-
1116 different modifications of the same characters‚—by fixing‚ in
fact, upon the greater or less developement of them, and not by
detecting any tangible differences among them,—that we can
hope to draw such boundary lines between the groups of the
family as will restrain the number of species contained in each
within moderate limits.

Hitherto the only material subdivisions that have been insti-
tuted in this family 60115151 of the genera Platgsrleynclzus‚ Desm.‚
and Muscipeta‚ Cuv. The former of these groups includes those
birds in which the broad and flattened bill, peculiar 10 1116 Lin-
nean ΛΊΙιιεεῖεαΡαε, 15 carried 10 1116 extreme bounds of its de·-
velopement. The breadth, which is nearly equal to that of the
head, extends nearly the whole length of the bill, which becomes
narrower only towards the apex. Such a character affords a
good foundation for a group. The genus Mascipeta does not
appear to be equally well defined. As it has been latterly
extended by those ornithologists who have adopted the name of
