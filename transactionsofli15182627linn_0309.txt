“ Τ116 native name of this bird 13 Jerryang'. This, like
0110ίὶ611, is seen in very large flocks in the Eue-alypti trees when
in blossom. The 1111111163 now and then bring in the young ones.v
but they seldom live long. I had three young ones for some
time, which used to huddle together and give out 11 very pleasing
note. They 1111 died strongly convulsed‚ and nearly 111 1116 smne
time3 the limbs were as stiff the moment life was extinct, 113 it'
the body had become cold.——The natives tell 1116 11 builds in the
hollow limbs of trees, making 110 other nest than of the decuyed
wood. It has four young ones. 'I'he eggs are white and without
spots.''—Caley’s MSS.

Mr. Caley adds, “that he has learned from the 1111111163 111111
1116 11631 of this species, of the Ground Pam-ot (N. pulchellum„
of the Dulang' (Pl. Pemzantii)‚ und of the Coolicll (Tri. concin-
nus), smell very strong and offensive of their dung.’'
