Cromer. Two others were caught by Mr. Downes in his garden
at Gunton in Suffolk; and a fourth was shot at Keswick near
Norwich.

Genus XI. Tuanes.

l„ T. viscc'vorzts (Missel Thrush).

The Missel Thrush sings its loud note till the beginning 01
lXIay, after which time it is not often heard. We have once,
and only once, heard it run through a great variety of the most
melodious notes, at a time when the male was wooing the female.
The young have somewhat the appearance of hawks. The old
birds are very tierce, and make a noise like a watchman's
rattle. We have witnessed a similar affray between a pair of
these birds and some magpies to that mentioned in White‘s
History of Selborne. After the loss of their brood, the old birds.
used from time to time to make a noise like a magpie.

2. T. pilaris (Fieldfare, Meslin-Bird).

In backward seasons the Fieldfare is late before it leaves this
country : it has been killed in the neighbourhood of Cronier the
111-51111661( in June. The bird had then more dark spots upon
the breast and sides than one which was killed in autumn, and
the spots upon the first part were of a deeper hue. A specimen
51101, at this season of the year is in the museum of ,loseph Sa-
bine, Esq. On the 5111 of May 1812, we saw ]⁴'ieldfares in
prodigious numbers, flying very high and steering due north.
They were probably migrating at that time, as none were after-
wards seen. We observed a very large fiock of these birds on
the Srd of May 1820: they were extremely 1111116, and suffered
us to approach within 11 few yards. They were observed again
on the following day in the morning, but were all gone 111 the
afternoon.
