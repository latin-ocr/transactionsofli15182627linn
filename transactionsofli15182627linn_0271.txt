'Phe powerful construction of the bill of this group separates
it at once from the other species of the llluscicapiclce, with
which in the depression and breadth at the base of that mem-
ber, the strength of the rictal bristles, and the general charac—
ters of the wings and legS, it otherwise accords. This strength
of bill would incline us to place the bird among the [Λυιὶιιιίω3
and in the subfaniily of Tyrannina, Swains.9 of which it might
thus be considered to form the Australian representative, did
not the other characters of its structure evince a more predonii-
nant inclination to the sssuscicapidae than to the Tyranni. The
group may, however, be considered to stand intermediately
between the two fainilies; and might perhaps be referred with
equal propriety to either, according to the characters which
each naturalist would select as most predonrinant, and most
convenient to guide him in his subdivisions. The habits of the
birds of the group, hitherto unknown, will have much intluence
in deterinining its exact station.
