Genus XVI. Mo'rAC1LLA.

2. M. Boarurztla (Gray Wagtail).

The Gray Wagtail is by no means uncommon in the autumn
and winter season in the low meadows by the river Gipping¹ in
Suffolk‚ and likewise in the neighbourhood of Higham. It is
also frequently met with in Norfolk at the same seasons. It
runs upon the tops of the weeds, which are partly submerged in
the ditches, and probably feeds upon the Dytisci and Cyrno,
which are almost always to be found in those situations.

3. Ill.flavct (Yellow Wagtail).
This species is not generally plentiful in Suffolk, though it is

pretty common on parts of the river lVaveney, which divides that
country from Norfolk.

Genus XVII. ANT11U8.
1. A. pratensis (Tit Lark).

2. Α. arboreus (Field Lark).

A common species in the neighbourhood of Harleston during
the summer ; and it is also found in various parts both of Norfolk
and Suffolk. This bird is subject not only to an Hippobosca,
but likewise to a large species of Acamas. Five of these insects
were taken off the head of a lark on the first day of its arrival.
