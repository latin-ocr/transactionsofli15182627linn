on the Hortus Ilsalalmricus, Part III. 85

Kalon Indel, he should have inquired whether the latter pro-
duces 11 gum or resin (laclwysnm), such as was used by the Roman
persumerS. This being by no means the case, the 11111116 Εἰαίε
is improperly applied to the Kalon Inclel.

Willdenow however (Sp. Pl. iv. 403), and the Hortus Kete-
ensis, v, 1280, continue to describe the Karou Imlel 115 the Elate,
a genus distinct from the I'hoeniw, and place it in Monam-effa lecir-
andria, probably because Rheede figures and describes only
the female tree, the tria albicantia lanuginosa staminula, which
he mentions, being the three pistilla. M. Lamarck (Em.
Metle. iii. 244), although he continues to describe it as the
Elate sylvestris, observes, “C'est un Palmier qui nous paroit
extremement voisin du Dattier (Plzoeniar clactgslijkra) par ces
rapportS, et dont nieme il est peut-Otre une espece.''’ The only
doubt Ι have is, whether or not it is to be considered 115 any
thing else than merely the uncultivated variety of the Plzoem'oe
dactylitem. Dr. Roxburgh indeed, an excellent authority, 111611-
tions (Hort. Beng. 73.) both a Pheraia* dactylitem and a P. syl-
vestris; which last I know to be the Κηίου Indcl, although he
does not quote it, deterred by the authority of so many great
botanists: but then in this catalogue he inserts, under distinct
names, plants which he admits to be mere varieties; 115 for
example, the Musa sapientum and JI. paradisiaca, p. 19: and Ι
must say, that looking with the utinost care at the common plant
of India, and 111111 known to have been brought fron] Arabia, like
those in the garden of the late Tippoo Sultaun, when in a simi-
lar state of growth,—-that is, when the stems were only 11 foot or
two in height, and before they began to flower,—I have not been
able to see the smallest difference between them, except that the
plant of Arabia was rather the largest and more vigorous.
With such 1111 extraordinary similarity, I should be very much
indeed surprised to find that the proper Date of Arabia had

only one pistillum; but if this be the case, we must admi the
specle>-
