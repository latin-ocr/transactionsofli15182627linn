as to the. number of specieS‚ still we must observe that they
appear to us, when judiciously moditied and faithfully inter-
preted, not merely to embrace all the later acquisitions of sei-
ence, and to include them within the bounds prescribed by their
natural affinities‚ but to evince an almost intuitive insight on the
part ot' that great master into the laws of nature. W'e have been
accustonicd‚ indeed, to contemplate with astonishment the ex-
pansiveness of those views with which he anticipated the modi-
lications of form which have been brought to light by succeeding
researchcs⁹ and provided a station for them in his system suited
to their place in nature. In but few instances have we seen
cause to object to those leading views ; and a slight inodilication
will stamp even these few instances as of equal value with the
rest. On the other hand, we are free to confess that among the
various systems of ornithology which have arisen professedly to
supersede his principles of arrangement, we see everywhere
what appears to us to be an unfaithful representation of nature.
W'hen we adhere, then, to the principles of Lirin-(rim, and to
those grand and leading divisions which he has portioned out
for our instruction, although with a modification of the ternis of
his nomenclature‚—a modification which the fleeting nature of
nomenclature itself renders necessary, and to which the scien-
tific language of our own days must submit in its turm—we
conceive that we. pay the most genuine homage to his genius
and reputation. Were we, on the other hand, to adhere strictly
to his nomenclature, and endeavour to square it to the gigantic
mass of materials that is progressively increasing upon us, we
consider that we should end-anger his reputation by exposing the
inadequacy of his system to any practical purposes‚ and thus
prove ourselves by ill—judged adulation to be the mere lip-

worshippers os his name.
lt is thus, by adhering to the general views of Linnaem, but
