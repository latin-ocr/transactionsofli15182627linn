308 Mr. Vmons’s andD1·.H0RsF1ELD's Description of the

In these characteristic peculiarities of the Tenuirostral Bircls,
the Troclzilislae or H nmmz‘ng-Birds of America display the greatest
perfection. In them the wing is long, strongly acuminated, and
formed for a rapid and constant ssight. The tail also exhibits
all the varieties of structure which we are accustomed to observe
in those birds whose habits are a'erial. On the other hand,
the bill is feeble, and apparently of service only in forming a
sheath to defend the tongue. The legs also are diminutive, and
peculiarly weak, apparently of little use but to assist the bird in
supporting itself when at rest; while the characteristic delicacy
os those members conspicuously unfolds itself by the downy
plumage descending from the thighs, with which covering na-
ture seems to have provided them as a means of warmth and
defence.

The nearest approach to the Hanmting-Birds is found in the
Cimzyridoe of the Old World. A line of distinction, however, is
drawn between the two families by the comparatively greater
strength of conformation in both the bill and legs of the latter
group. The wings also, although still formed for a suspended
flight, lose the strongly-marked length and acumination of those
01 the Trochilus: they are more. rounded‚ and the first quill-
feather is short, almost indeed spurious. W⁷e do not observo,
moreover, that varied form of the tail which adds apparently so
much to the purposes of fiight among birds: in some species,
indeed, the middle tail-feathers are elongated beyond the late-
ral, but hitherto we have seen no approach to the forked con-
formation. These two families however, although they may
thus be distinguished from each other, may yet be united to-
gether as forming the Nor-mal (ἲν-(ηιμ of the Tribe. In comparison
with the remaining families which form the Aba-rant subdi-
vision of it and lead off to other neighbouring Tabes, they pos-
sess a generally weaker conformation ; and their mode of taking
