on the Hortus Malabaricus, Part III. 91

which he was followed by Burman (Fl. [ΜΖ. 51.)‚ who added to
the synonyma the Bancalus of Rumphius (Herb. Amb. iii. 84.
tab. 55). Now in this plate there are two figures : of which the
first represents (setting aside the errors in the direction to the
plate) the Bancalus mas ct parvif'olia, which may perhaps be con-
sidered as the same with the Katozc Tsjalca, although this is by
no means clear. Without any attention to the fact of two plants
being figured in tab. 55 by Rumphius, and laying aside his
usual accuracy, M. Lamarck quotes the Bancalus (tab. 55.) for
his Ceplzalantlms chineus-is (Enc. Meth. i. 678.)‚ leaving it doubt-
ful whether or not the Nazaclea orientalis is different; but he
does not quote the Katozc Tsjalca. Afterwards ἼΜ. Poiret does
not diminish the confusion by giving us a Naaclea orientalis, for
which he quotes the Ceplzalantlzzcs chimensis, the Ceplzalantlms of
Linnaeus, and Bancalzts of Rumphius with doubt, while he refers
the Καίοιι Tsjalca to his Naue-lea city-{folia (Enc. Metlz. iv. 435),
distinguishing this from his N. orientalis by its having the pe-
dunculus shorter than the fiower3 while in his N. orientalis this
member is much longer, as represented by M. Lamarck (Ill.
Gen, t. 153. f.1.). Still later, M. Poiret endeavours (Enc. Metlz.
Sap. iv. 63.) to point out differences between his Nauclea orien-
talis and Cephalantlz.us chimensis, which is the chuclca purpurea
of Roxburgh and Willdenow (Sp. Pl. i. 9282). Now all this
seems wrong: for the Καίοιι Tsjalsa 15 1116 Nam-lea orientalis or
Ceplzalantlzzcs foliis oppositis of Linnaeus; and the Nauclea citri-
folia, like this having a short pedunculus, is the real Naue-lea
orientalis3 while the N. orientalis figured by M. Lamarck must
be considered as a new species, and from the size and shape of
its leaf might be called N. citrifolia, were 11 not for leading into
error. Resides, before we can safely refer the N. purpurea or
Cephalantlzus chimensis to the chcalus (tab. 55.)‚ we must know
whether the first or second figure of Rumphius is meant. Neither
