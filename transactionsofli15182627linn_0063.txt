1. S. Cantiaca (Sandwich Tern).

The Sandwich Tern has been killed at Yarmouth. On the
5111 of May 1890, we shot two of these birds at &Valton in Essex.
They had made their appearance only two days previous. The
foreheads of these birds were black‚ and the extent of their
wings 3 feet 1} inches. That described by Bewick, being less
in breadth and having a white forehead, was probably a young
bird, The legs of the Sandwich T ern are very strong ; the claws
crooked and strong. It has a very flapping kind of ssight, and
often sits on the sands at the edge of the water. It may be
distinguished from the other kinds by its 11010, which is stronger
than that of the common species. On the 24111 of April last
we saw two of these birds swimming in the Stour, one of which
we shot.

The Common, Black, and Lesser Terns all breed on the coasts
and in the marshes of Norfolk, and are plentiful in some parts.
Towards the end of summer T erns congregate, and appear in
large flocks upon the ooze of Breydon Water.
