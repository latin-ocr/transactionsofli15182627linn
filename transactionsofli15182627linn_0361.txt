ln every point of view this moss seems sufficiently distinct.
'l'he leaves are very strikingly vascular, and in this respect
resemble those of an unpublished Nepalese species in my pos-
sesslon.

On the ground ’ἲ (No station given.)

Slem about half an inch in height, robust, covered with brown
tonientose radicular fibres, branched with very short inno-
vations. Lea-ecs few on the lower part of the stein, densely
crowded and somewhat spreading at. the top : they are
rather broadly obovate (those of the innovations narrower),
pointed, slightly concave, denticulate towards the apex, the
margin decidedly thickened: nerve strong, and running
more or less beyond the point, but never hair-like or trans—
parent. The colom· of the lower leaves is reddish ; that of
the upper ones a dull green, which is much brighter under
the microscope, their base being moreover frequently of a
beautiful deep pink. The nerve and thickened margin are
also often reddish. The reticulation is small, the cellules
roundish, except at the base, where they are elongated.
Fruitstallc nearly two inches long, dark red. Capsecle pen-
dulous, brownish-lecl, large, clavate, the licl shortly and
obtusely conical; this part, however, I have not seen in a
mature state. Inner peris-tome equal in length to the onter
one, each tooth composed of from 3 to 5 ribs terminating in
a point, and connected by transverse bars. I could not
perceive any alternating cilice.
