οη the Hortus Malaharicas, Part ΙΙῙ. 1⁶29

Mal-abar, I suspect should have been written Naga Clnnnpo, the
latter word being the same with the Tyampalsam of the vulgar
dialect, while the specitic term Naga implies that the tree is con-
nected with the divine serpent, although it must be confessed‚ as
we shall see, that another derivation is given.

Plukenet (Alm. 90), adhering to the opinion of Comincline,
called this tree Castanea rosea ludica. Linnaeus (ΡΙ. ,ΞέζιχᾹ ⁶303.)
quoted it for the second variety os his sslcsuafoliis lmavolaffis, his
first variety being the Arbor Naglms sive ferrea of'ssurman (Thes.
ΞΨΖ. (ἰᾷ). This author says, that in the Ceylonese dialect Nagltas
or Naglzalza implies Arbor ferrea. Glzas or Glzalea no doubt
signifies a tree or plant: but Na is quite different from any
Indian name of iron thatl know of; and I suspect that the name
should have been written Nag’ Glms or Nag' Ghalm, the serpent’s
tree. Ι observe nothing in the account of Burman that should
lead to a suspicion of his plant being in any respect different
from that of Rheede. Willdenow has however joined it with
the Nagassarinm of Rumphius (Ilerb. Amh. vii. 3. t. (ΞΛ, which,
if not a different species, is at least a very remarkable variety :
as it is a small tree (irittzcus von ultra ser pedes emensus), with
leaves less than those of the Willom and like those of the Olive ;
nor has its fruit the four remarkable ribs so conspicuous on
that of the Belutta Tyampalsam. So great indeed is the diffe-
rence between the two plants, that the younger Burman consi—
dered them as belonging to two distinct genera (Fl. Iml. ier),
the plant of Rumphius being his Calopliyllum Nagassarz'um, and
that of Rheede his illesuaferrea‚ as it is that of Linnaeus. This
supposition of the two plants belonging to different genera I
have no doubt is an error ; and the plant of Rumphius, which is
pretty common in the North-east of Bengal and in Ava, is no
doubt a Mesua, but Ι an] inclined to think of a different species
from the tree described by Rheede, which however I have not
