The generic name Keml is also given, with a specific appella-
tion prefixed, to another tree‚ which I think is the Dios-pyros cor—
clzfolia of Dr. Roxburgh (Hort. Beng. 40.)‚ a name that has been
adopted by other botanists (Willd. Sp. Pl. iv. 1111. Enc. lueth.
v. 432. Hort. Κεῖῳ. v. 479). Ι have presented specimens of
this tree to the library at the India House (Cat. No. 9391). In
the Hindwi dialect of Behar it is called Malan- Kome,- but
according to Dr. Carey, in the Bengalese dialect it is called
Βιιη Gab, that 15, the wild Embryopteris; yet it has no very
striking resemblance either to this plant or to the others called
Kencl. This, besides, agrees entirely with Mr. Brown’s cha-
racter of Diospyros; and as the differences between it and the
species already described may lead to a more proper discrimi-
nation of genera than at present exists among the Εὺεηαεειε, Ι

shall here describe it.
