Linnaeus further states, in the Lachesis Lapponica, respecting
the effects produced by this sort of OEstrus, that in passing after-
wards into the Lapland alps he observed a Rein-deer, which was
loaded with his own package, frequently to stop short and
become perfectly quiet and motionless as a pillar of stone, or

again resume his march. Where, I would ask, is the trahamus,
or Conops, that could produce effects like these ¹? or what natu-

could confound the dissimilar effeets produced by these several
insects ?

Linnaeus further sayS‚ that in the Rein-deer fly he saw the
688 held out “like a white mustard-seed’' at the end of the
abdomen, which, if true, fully confirms the supposition that
there can be no infliction-
