Ficus rupestre's, and under this name gave 11 drawing· and speci-
mens to Sir J. E. Smith.

One or other of these plants, but which Ι cannot say, is pro-
bably the Ficus tomentosa of W'illdenow (Sp. Pl. iv. 11:30),
which, 116 says, he had from Dr. Roxburgh, who mentions it in
the Hortus [ἔως-1116115115, 103, without reference to any figure.
I should certainly have considered my Picus rupestris as the
F. mollis¹ of Vahl, had he 1101 described the fruit as solitary3 yet
&Villdenow quotes Vahl's plant as being the same with his,
which he describes 10 have 1116 fruit growing· in pairs. Perhaps
he had learned that vahl was mistaken; sor M. Poirct (Eue.
Metlz. Sap. ii. (353.) follows Willdenow without remark. As
W'illdenow’s plant has the 11111161· side of the leaves smooth, it is

perhaps my Ficus asinina ‚9

I have already mentioned the affinity of this tree with the
Tsjeron Meer Alou (t. 502), from which it differs in having the
leaves more unequal sided and more SC'dbl'OUS, and the figs
larger. It has a still stronger affinity with the Tcregam (t. OQ),
which with leaves shaped like the 'l'fjerou Mem· Α lou, and a fruit
like the Atti 111661· Αἶοιι, 15 11 great deal rougher than either.
The two plants are however 50 11111611 alike, that the description
