IN submitting to the Linnean Society the following observations
on the Ornithology of New llolland, which have been founded
upon an examination of the birds contained in their valuable
collection, we presume that little explanation, much less apology,
is necessary for the mode in which our researches have been
conducted. The mode, we need scarcely premise, accords with
those principles which have been introduced into zoology by
one of the most distinguished naturalists of this Society, and is
founded upon the affinities and analogies of the groups of the
animal world, with the view of ascertaining their station in
nature.

In regulating our researches according to these principles, we
have found it necessary to make some partial alterations in the
nomenclature which has been generally adopted in this country,
until lately, for the groups of ornithology. And in introducing
this modification of the scientific ternis of Linnaeus, we feel some
apprehensions that we may be supposed to deviate from those
principles of our great master, which the naturalists of this coun-

trkx.
