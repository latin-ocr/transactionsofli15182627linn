394 Mr. BELL οη two new Genera qs Laml Tortoise&

Some time after Ι had received the living specimen of which
I have spoken, my friend Mr. J. E. Gray showed me two spe-
cimens of another species, very closely allied to the former, and
having exactly the sanie peculiarity of structure. These were
presented by Sir Everard Home to the British RIuseum, and
have received from Mr. Gray the specific name of Homeana. I
have now in my collection a third specimen of the latter species.

To the genus thus constituted, Ι have applied the name Ki-
lers‚ from κινέω moveo, and ἱξὺς lumbus.

The other genus, which it is the objectos this paper to den
scribe, possesses also one peculiarity which is interesting in a
similar point of view, as exhibiting a further affinity, or possibly
only an analogical relation, to the Box Tortoises, although itself
strictly belonging to the terrestrial family. From a careful ex-
amination of the Tortoises with a moveable sternum, and a. com-
parison of them with every other group, I was convinced that
wherever either of the transverse sutures of the bones composing
the sternum is exactly adapted to the transverse division of the
stcrnal scuta, there is no bony union of the two portions, and
the moveable sternum consequently exists; and that such a
structure could be thus ascertained, even in dried specimens,
where the parts had become completely fixed.

This opinion Ι was led for a time to consider erroneous, in
consequence of examining the shell of a new species of Tortoise,
evidently of the terrestrial form, and belonging therefore to the
Testuclinz‘doe. This specimen had lost the anterior lobe of the
sternum; and from the appearance of the fracture, it was obvi—
ous that the suture of the bone and the junction of the humeral
and pectoral plates had existed exactly at the same line: and as
no such structure as that of a moveable portion of the sternum
had ever been found to belong to any Tortoise of a similar ge-
neral conformation, I believed that this sact was probably fatal
