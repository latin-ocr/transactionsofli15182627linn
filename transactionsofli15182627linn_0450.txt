IN the 14th volume of the Transactions (gf tlte Limzean Society,
is a communication written by my friend W. S. MacLeay, Esq.,
intended to prove that the fly, intitled Oistros by the ancients‚
was not the insect so named by Linnzeus, but that it probably
belonged to the present Linnean genus Tubunas.

Being of a contrary opinion, I am led once more to address
this learned Society, to lay before them the grounds on which it
is founded, that naturalists may not incautiously and too hastily
adopt the above conclusion, and that they may avoid the con-
fusion which change of names and counter changes always pro-
duce in science. I am also led to this undertaking in order to
vindicate Linnaeus himself, our great master, and such distin—
guished naturalists as Vallisneri and Reaumur, with whose
views on this subject I wholly concur. Nor is the justification
of myself wanting as a motive to induce me to re-examine the
subject, having formerly sent to this Society a dissertation of
some extent on the genus OEstrus, unfolding some curious dis-

coveries
