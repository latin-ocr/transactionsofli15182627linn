Capitis plumae frontales albae, proximae nigroe, fasciam nigram
formantem cristales nigrae, basi griseae; occipitales nucha-
lesque subgrisescentes. Tectrices inferiores, remigesque sub-
tus basi albescentes. Rostrum nigrum, mandibulae supe-
rioris apice pallido. Longitudo emporis, 7ffi; alce a carpo
ad remigem quartam, 4& 3 cazcclae, 3†¹‹-› ; rostri ad frontem, ξ,
ad rictum, {w ; tarsi, 1525.

The specimen of this species in the Society's collection is in
very indifferent condition, and the uppel· mandible llas unfortu—
nately been mutilated. We cannot therefore refer it with cer-
tainty to the present genus. From what we can judge however
ot' the bill, it accords with that of the type of Falcunczzlns, with
the exception of the notch being less strongly marked. In the
characters of the wingS, tail, and tarsi, it agrees very accurately
with the present genus.

This bird was presented to the Society by Mr. Brown‚ and was
procured by that gentleman at Kent’s Group, December 1803.
