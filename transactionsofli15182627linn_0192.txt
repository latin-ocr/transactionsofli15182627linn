with their distinguishing peculiarities‚ which we conceive will
prove of interest to the Society. We are indebted for much of this
valuable information to Mr. Caley, who collected the greater part
of the New llolland birds belonging to the Society; and who
kimlly allowed us to make use of his original notes on these
birds, written during= his residence in the colony. We have also
to express a similar acknowledgement to Mr. Brown, who, in his
¹general zeal for science, did not neglect the interests of zoology
while devoting himself to the advancement of his favourite
study. 'l'o his liberality the Society is indebted for many of
its choicest treasures; and the kindness with which he has
communicated his information respecting them enhances their
value.

Still we have to regret that we are but imperfectly acquainted
with a considerable number of the more important forms in the
collection, either as to their manners or their internal anatomy3
and that many of our observations on them must necessarily be
founded on conjecture. Great imperfectior] may consequently
be expected in our details. A favourable prospect, however,
opens to us of having our deficiencies supplied on many of
these. points; but a prospect, which we scarcely know whether
we should most rejoice in or lament. The removal of the late
Secretary of this Society to an important official situation in the
country whose ornithology we are about to investigate, encou-
rages us to hope for much valuable assistance to our labours;
while at the same time we cannot avoid regretting 1115 temporary
absence from a Society, which is bound to him by every tie of
respect and gratitude. But the evils attendant on separation
will be softened down on both sides by the continued intercourse
which science thus fortunately holds out between us; and wc
shall be the less estranged, in being still participators in his
eminent zeal for our common pursuit. We hope we do not
