of the two : he would frequently erect his crest, and both of them
would snap their beaks at each other by way of menace. He
had no regular song⁷ but uttered notes resembling those of the
Greater Redpole and Green Grosbeak‚ and also the gentle com-
placent note occasionally uttered by the female Cliaffincl1.—La-
tham says the legs are gray, and Bewick describes them as pale-
brown. The hind part of the legs and the bottoms of the feet
of a specimen which we exmnined, were of a bright yellow. In
a female killed late in April, the remark of Linnaeus, alarum
basi subtus flavissima, was very striking.

7. F. cannabino (Common Linnet).

S. F. montium (Twite, French Linnet).

This is a winter bird of passage. We have found them plenti-
ful iu the month of October on Pewit Island, and on the main
land of Essex near it, in fiocks often and twenty together; and
towards evening we noticed a flock of about a hundred: so that
it seems not improbable that the flocks may collect together to
pass the night. No other birds were mixed with these flocks‚
which were feeding on the seeds of the Marsh Samphire (Sali-
cornia herbacea), and Sea Starwort (Asler tripolitan). Their little
twittering note, as they sit or fiy, might easily be mistaken for
that of the Siskin; but their ay, ceys, ay, tache, troile, tte-ite, (whence
certainly their name,) at once distinguishes them. Twites are
found in the salt-marshes near Yarmouth : and we have seen a
flock of thern at Shotley Point in Suffolk. A Twite was killed on
the 23rd of May; so that a few may perhaps breed in this coun-
try. Mr. Scales informs us that this species of Finch visits
Beechamwell very early in the spring, and feeds upon the seeds
of the Alder as they drop from the cones.
