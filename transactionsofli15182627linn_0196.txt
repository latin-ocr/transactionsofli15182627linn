In Mr. Caley's MSS. we find the following observations on
this bird :—“ ssIillc-wlzite IIazelr. This bird was shot near Duck-
river, which is a branch of Port J ackson harbour, about two
miles from Paramatta on the road to Sydney. I have seen the
species very sparingly. The natives tell me it feeds upon fish.
Its weight is llb. 12 oz. The iricles are light olive, but with a
shade of yellow.—Feb. 1809.''

There are two specimens os this bird in the British lNIuseum,
and we have seen two other specimens exactly according with
ours, which were lately brought to this country from New Hol-
land. We have also heard of some other specimens. We have
therefore little doubt of its being a distinct species, and not the

white variety of another, as suggested by M. Cuvier in his
‘⁶ Regne Animalssss’

compliment to individuals‚ or names expressing a native or provincial designation,-—can
be of little usc in pointing out a species. Local names, unless actually misapplied, (in
which case they should of course be altere‹l‚) will be at least as appropriate. as these.
On the whole, we consider the multiplicatiori of synonyms, and the confusion
necessarily resulting from it, to be a greater error in nomenclature than the want of
significance in a specific name. And although, from the circumstance of objections
having been started against local nameS, we agree that they hhould be Sparingly used
in future; yet when once they have been established, we conceive it more prudent to
retain them, acting upon thc only sure ground which can be assumed in all such
cases,—the ground of priority. ²* Tom. i. p. 320.
