136 Dr. FRANms HAMILTON’S Commentary

which we shall soon have occasion to return. When, however,
Linnaeus published the second edition of his Species Plantarum,
he added many other synonyma, and among these an American
plant described by Catesby; from which alone, as M. Lamarck
justly observes (Enc. Metle. ii. 49.5.)‚ he seems to have drawn his
specifie character, this probably having been the only one of the
plants quoted that he had actually seen.

M. Lamarck, therefore, returns to 1110 first supposition of Lin-
noeus, and gives the Karou Alou as the true Ficus Indica, refer-
ring to it all the synonyma of old botanists, who meant to describe
the 1100 of Pliny and 'l‘heophrastus ;-but what probability is
there that a tree growing neglected in the obscure parts of the
South, should be that noticed by the Greeks and Romans 111
1110 North of India, while in every part the Pet-alu is cultivated
with a religious veneration'? The very Malabar names show
the difference : Ala or Aloe( being the generic name, Per signi-
fies Tree, as if we should say Arbor Alou (licta by way of excel-
lence: while Katon implies this species of Alou to be the sylves-
tris, to use the language of the. older botanists. In the same
manner the Pei-alu by the Brahmans of Malabar 15 called Ῥαά-
leon (from Γαΐα of the Sanscrit) by way of excellence3 while the
Katoa Λ lou is distinguished by a specific term (Doulo) prefixed,
to mark its not being 1110 11110 prototype of the genus. Ι approve
therefore entirely of the change made by Willdenow, who,
although he knew nothing of the Καίοιι Alma except from the
Hortus Malabaricns, calls it Ficus citi-{folia (Sp. l'l. iv. 1137).

Dr. Roxburgh, so far as we can judge from the Hortus Ben-
galensis, would not seem to have seen any tree which he referred
to the Ficus citrg'f'olia or Kalon Alou: but in the South of India
l found a tree which l should have had no doubt was the same,
had I ever seen roots descending from its branc-hes: but this Ι
never did, and the natives assured me that it does not possess
