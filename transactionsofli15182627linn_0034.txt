1. Α. arvensis (Skylark).

It appears from the following remarks of Mr. Xl'oolnough os
Hollesley, that these birds frequently migrate into this country
from the Continent in autumn, and return thither in the spring.
Mr. W. 111115 writes :—“ I have frequently 50011 lztrlfs and roolss
come fiying off the sea ; not in one year only, but in many : not
on one day only 111 1110 sanie year, but on several. I have seen
them coming off the Sea for many 1101115 111 1110 same day ;—the
lca-les from five and ten to forty or fifty in a flock ; the roolss, 011
1110 5111110 day, in companies from three to fifteen. This I once
observed in November sor three days in succession: the early
part of that month was the general time of their coming: our
fields were then covered with the lai-les, to the great destruction
of the late-sown wheat. They generally remained with 115 1111
1110 11151 heavy fall of snow, and then disappeared. Early in the
February following they appeared again on the coast in innu-
merable fiocks, but disappeared as soon as the weather became
fine, with a light. westerly wind z from which circumstance I con-
cluded that they again erossed the sea. They appeared 10 me
to be the same as our common Slx'ylarks.

‘⁵ Those [ιη-115 and rooli‘s that I have seen coming off the sea, did
not appear like birds that had fiown off for pleasure : they always
fiew low, close to the water, ancl seemed fully intent 011 reaching
the shore, on which they often alighted directly on reaching it.'’
