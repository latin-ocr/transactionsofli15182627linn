Mr. HrLLs on the Antilopc Clzz'clsara. 505

sent you, are individuals of the same species, although shades of
difference do exist amongst them. I submit that the descriptions
and drawings of the General's Antilope and M. Duvallcel's, by a
singular coincidence, must have both been made from imperfect
specimens with regard to the first pair ofhorns‚ as an inspection
of the two skulls now in the College Museum will make clearly

manifest.
There is a difference of three inches between the height at the

shoulder, as estimated by General Ilardwicke‚ and that which Ι
have given ; but I followed the projection of the shoulder from
the spine. The General probably placed his animal under an
horizontal bar.

llow easily it may lmppen, that accounts drawn up with equal
care and correctness, by different persons, of the same animal,
and even of the same individual (and more particularly if it be of
the deer kind), shall, owing to some unconsidered variation of
circumstances, appear to arraign the fidelity of each other!

I am, Sir,
Your most humble servant,

Ronnm- IIILLS.
