THE proximity of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk to the
northern part of the Continent, affords an opportunity to many
migrative speeies of birds to visit these parts of the kingdom, in
their passage to ancl from their breeding haunts. The abundance
of food which the sea-coasts, rivers, and marshes supply to the
waders and weh-footed birds forins an attraction to these tribes.
Hence this district is particularly favonrable to the pursuits of
ornithologists. The following paper has been drawn up with a
view to facilitate such pursuits, and to illustrate the history of
several species of birds. Its object will be sufficiently answered
if this end shall be in any degree accomplished; and, at the
same time, some light thrown upon the wisdom and goodness of
the Author of Nature in the works of his creation.

The classitication and names adopted are those of the second
edition of Temminck's Manuel d’Ornitlzologie, a work which
