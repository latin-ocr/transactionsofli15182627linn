,5012 Mr. HILLs on the Antilope Clzz'clcara.

The general hue is a fulvous brown, which however will pro-
bably, as 111 1116 Stag, become duller at the approach of winter.
Along the vertebral line the colour is rather da1·ker; it is lighter
and neutralized on the insides of the limbssss’ which are pied of
the general colour and white. The upper part of the rostrum
is of a brown chocolate, which gradually, as it approaches the
nostrils, melts into their colour,—a deep purplish gray. Along
the margin and side of the nether jaw, from symphysis to ramus,
white. The throat‚ breast, and abdomen, a low-toned, and, in
parts, yellowish-white. In form and colour the ear closely
resembles that of the fidlozewoloured specimen of the common
Cervus palmatus. Eye large and prominent, and the pupil very
large even when exposed to a strong light.

In most of the Deer tribe, in the Ox, Sheep, Goat, and also in
every other Antilope that I have seen, the lubricous character
of the apex and alze of the nose comes in pretty contrast with
the hair-clad parts that surround them and form the muzzle ;
but in this creature the covering of the facial ridge, from a little
below the first pair of 1101115, becomes shorter and shorter so gra-
dually, that there is no such line of termination. The nostrils
are small, and more perpendicularly placed than in any of the
animals just alluded to. These pointS, and the tumidulous ap-
pearance of the fiap that protects the sul», or, as I should rather
call 11, onte-ocular sinus, give a less agreeable aspect to the
head, when viewed in front, than it has in profile.

The following is, though perhaps unsatisfactory, the best
description I can give of the horns:—Length of the first or
smallest pair, 1-3- inch, slightly recurvate towards their tips;
length of the second pair, 3} inches, irregular, wavy protended
coneS, obtusely pointed ; in a trifiing degree concave anteriorly,

*ᾗ Τ1115 is so common a circumstance among all quadrupeds, that it may seem
scarcely worth mention.
