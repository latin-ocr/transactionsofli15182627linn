Mr. Caley first observed this species in some high trees in the
neighbourhood of Paramatta ; but did not meet with it for many
years afterwards. The birds however frequented the trees in the
brush along the upper part of Duck River, in great abundance.
although it was at a late period of his residence in the colony
that he met with them at that place. He imagines that their
coming to Paramatta when he first saw them was accidental.

'We have some doubt as to this species being the same as that
of M. Vieillot: the blackish marking round the eye in our spe-
cies being wanting 111 1116 figure in the “Oiseuua‘ d01*t‘’s.'’

One of the specimens of this species in the Society's collec-
tion was procured by Mr. Brown at Shoalwater Bay in 1802.
The species, as well as the next, are noticed by Mr. Caley as
being by no means unconnnon: but he has made no remarks

upon their manners.
