The differences between this description taken in Mysore and
that taken at Mungher are too 1111111ιὲΥ to establish even two
varieties of one speeies. From the structure of the filaments,
not only this plant, but the Mabolo should, according to the
characters laid down by Brown (Noa. noll. i. 525), be more
nearly allied to the Paralia, and even to the Roycna, than to the
Diosstyros. These characters, however, seem rather insufficient
to mark well-defined genera.

It must be observed that I have met with another tree of
nearly the same name, which has a stronger resemblance to the
Panitsjilca than that above described. From its leaves being
carved as it were in a similar manner, I have in the catalogue of
specimens presented to the India Company’s library (No. 2:388)
called it Hyas-pyros insculpta; and, although I have not seen the
flower, I shall here give a description.
