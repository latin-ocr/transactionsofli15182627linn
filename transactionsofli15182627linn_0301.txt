me it breeds chiefly in a white Gum-tree (a species of Eucalyp-
tus), making its nest of a little grass, and lining it with feathers.
It has as many as txvelve young ones. The eggs are of a dirty-
white with black specks. The nest is found by the bird en-
larging the hole to creep in at. This process gives the sur-
rounding part a reddish appearance, which, forming a contrast
with the whiteness of the other partS‚ renders it conspicuous.''

Genus. PEzoponUs. Ill.

The birds of this genUS‚ which was first characterized by
M. Illiger, differ essentially from those of the last by the form
of the tail, which, instead of being broad and depressed, 1>-
narrow and cuneated, and has the feathers pointed at the apex.
The toes also seem even still more appropriated to the ground
than those of Platycercus‚ being longer and straighter, and the
nails being less falcated. The outer webs of the quill-feathers
are less indented‚ and the indenture is nearer the apex ,· while¹
the under mandible also exhibits a slighter emargination than
in the latter genus, thus evincing a greater recession from the
groups that approach the Maccam. There has hitherto been
but one species discovered of the gemm, which appears confined
to New Holland.
