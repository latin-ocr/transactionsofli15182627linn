also are short and feeble‚ and the toes weak and irregular; the
middle toe, however, is furnished with a serrated nail, which
seems in some measure to compensate for the general deficiency
of the member, the serration being apparently intended, as has
been observed in a former volume of our “Transactions,'’ for
the purposes of seizureff. The present genus iAEg‘otlzeles· evidently
exhibits a deviation from these typical characters. The wings
lose the superior powers of ssight displayed in the true Capri-
mulgns, and instead of being long and acuminated become
short and rounded3 the bill and legs assume somewhat of the
length and strength usually attached to these parts; while as
the latter members regain their general powers, the serration of
the middle unguis, which accompanied the weaker conformation‚
entirely disappears. The rictal bristles also partially lose their
strength and regularity of disposition ; and here, as well as in the
succeeding group of Poclargzts, seem to be transferred to the
front or base of the bill.

The distinction between sEgotlzeles and the true Caprimulgus
is thus sufficiently evident. From M. Cuvier's genus Poclargus
the former group also differs in its general comparatively weaker
(mnformation, holding in this respect an intermediate place
between Caprimulgus and Podar-gas. The bill is more depressed
than in Podar-gas, and more generally widened towards the
apem: the shape and the disposition of the nares* also, as well as
the structure of the quill-feathers‚ is different. The tarsi are
weaker and more compressed, and at the same time compara—
tix‘ely more elongated: and the toes are nearly even, while in
l'ndargus the middle toe is considerany longer than the rest.
We have hitherto met with but one species belonging to this
torm which seems eontined to New Holland.
