the word specieS, it is not previously defined. Thus much in-
deed has been thought requisite ; that in botany these common
characters should be taken from the parts of fructification, and
in zoology from such parts as are indicative of structure and
habits. “ Α genus should surnish a character, not a character
form 11 genus.'’ We are not here, as in the word species, pre-
cluded fron] inquiry by a previous definition. Though both
words are ternis of geneialization, there is the same difference
between them, as instrulnents of reasoning, as between a defi-
nition and a proposition in geometry.

The species includes all the characters which are in the genus,
and those likewise which distinguish that 51166165 fron] others be-

Naturalists by this invention, which is not 611611151116117 their own,
have it in their power to contemplate and reason upon these
separate characters, with all their consequences‚ 115 if they ex-
isted independently of species; as by the use of the word species
they are enabled to look at their peculial· attributes indepen-
dently of individuals. This faculty of the mind, which is one of
the most curious that belongs to it, has given rise in all languages
