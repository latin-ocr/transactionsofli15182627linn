Australian Birds in tlte Collection of tlte Linnean Society. 301

further from that gentleman, we find that his suspicions were
founded merely on the circumstance of his having met with all
these birds in the same place and at the same period. Although
we have some doubt respecting our C. incertus being a ‘distinct
species, we have little respecting the present bird, which seems
to belong to a different section of the genus from that in which the
preceding species are included. The wings are shorter and more
rounded, the tail also shorter and less graduated, and the tarsi are
more naked and more elevated. There are six or seven species
of Cuculus belonging to Australia and Africa, which form part of
the same section of the group, and which differ from the bird
before us only in their colours being bright and metallic. It is
the want of these colours chiefly that causes us to consider the
specimen before us as a young bird. In its general structure
it has the characters of the birds to which we allude, and which
in their young state are also without the shining tints of the
adult birds, although perhaps not so decidedly so as our present
species.

Mr. Caley informs us that he met with the three last-described
species in the neighbourhood of Paramatta. They frequented
the green wattle-trees which were of low growth. They made
their appearance on the approach of winter3 and it was Mr. Ca-

ley’s opinion that they migrated southerly at the commence—
ment of spring.
