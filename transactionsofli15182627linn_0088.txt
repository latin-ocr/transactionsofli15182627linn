76 ssIr. BENNETT οη a peculim· Proper-ty

the present notice appears to be the Echinus salratilis of Linnaeus3
but the character assigned to this species by that distinguished
naturalist is so indefinite as to preclude the possibility of cer-
tainty on this point. It however coincides precisely with the
description given by Leske of his Cidaris rupes-tris, and with
Lamarck's specitic character of his Echinus lividns; both of
these authors (the latter with a mark of doubt) referring to this
species of Linnaeus as synonymous with theirs respectively. The
appositeness of the trivial names both of Linnaeus and of Leske
to the habitat of the animal in question, might lead to the
suspicion that they were acquainted with the property noticed
above: but there is no reference in either of them to any au-
thor by whom it has been mentioned. Rumphius, indeed, de-
scribes the Echinus saxatilis as inhabiting ‘⁶ the holes and cavi-
ties of corals, in which they sometimes grow to such a size that
it is impossible to pull them out.'' But these words evidently
imply his opinion that it sought holes previously formed, in
which it increased in bulk; and do not even hint at the con-
clusion, that itself formed and enlarged the cells in which it
dwelt.

XVhether the species of Echinus described and figured by
Rumphius, and referred to by Linnaeus as synonymous with his
E. saxatilis, be identical with the one which inhabits the western
coasts of lreland, may probably, on account of their geographi-
cal distribution, be regarded as doubtful, the former having
been discovered in the Indian Seas. The species of this genus
are, however, so difficult to determine, and so little understood,
that I will not at present venture to decide upon this question.
If not identical, they are at least analogous ; and l may mention
as a fact bearing upon this point, that I have lately seen a spe-
cimen of Echinus, brought by Captain King, F.L.S., from New

[Iolland.
