66 Mr. W. S. MACLEAY on the structure of tlte Tarsus

with their notions of affinity3 the consequence being, that al-
though proposed as a natural system, they proved it to be arti-
ficial ;--115, for instance, in the case of the genus Iletcrocerus,
which is aclx‘nowledged by them to be tetramerousffz and is never-
theless placed among the Pentamera. lt was therefore with some
shadow of reason that other entomologistS, who regarded all simi-
lar systems only as they were convenient dictionaries, complained
at being called upon to see more 1111111 really existed 111 nature,
and to account such an insect to be pentamerous merer because
the French system would have it so.

The leading objections, however, which I have made to this
system 111 1116 Home Entomologz'cae are, in the 11151 place, that it
111115 de facto 111 115 object 01 superseding the Linnean and Fa-
brician systems; 11111511111611 115, instead of giving 115 11 natural
series, it has only added to the number of artificial systems
already invented: and secondly, that it fails ‹lejure; that, in
brief, it could not have done otherwise than fail, inasmuch as
it 11115, 11κ6 111051 other principles 01 arrangement, been erro·
neously applied to divide Colcoptera, when the grand requisite
must always be the natural method 01 uniting them. lt is indeed,
as Ι have elsewhere attempted to show 1, a great error to confound
the Creator's distribution of 1115 works with our own method 01
dividing a subject into heads for the sake of perspicuity. That
system, in short, which depends on the division of organs or pro—
perties must necessarily be 111111161111, while that which depends
on their mctltod (gf variatum must be the natural one.

1111 l have now to propose a third objection to the 11115111
system: an objection which will, Ι suspect, not a little sur-
prise thos<¹ entomologists who have been in the 11111111 of adopt-
ing it as a convenient mode of arranging the 6011161115 01 their
cabinets. Ι1 is. that the very basis ol' this system 15 61101160115,
