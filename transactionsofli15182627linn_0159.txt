on the Hortus Malabaricus, Part III. 147

TsJELA, J). 85. t. 63.

The natives of Malabar seem to consider this Ficus as the
prototype of 11 genUS, giving it no specilic name. What Ty'ela
means, Ι (10 1101 know; but Asouatou, (the name used by the
31111111111115) 15 1116 5111116 with Aszc’attlza, a name given by the
Bengalese to the Ficus religiosa. Both indeed 1116 very nearly
allied: for they have sessile figs growing 111 pairs, and neither
sends roots from the branches. Further, both 1116 usually para-
sitical plnnts, and at first take root either on other trees or on
walls, which they soon destroy, leaving 11 congeries of roots
above-ground in place of a stem. Both however, if planted in
the ground, thrive well, and produce stately and ornamental
5161115. There 1116, however, several other Fici which grow in a
similar parasitical mannen and among these, some of 1116 kinds
called faringa by Rumphius, and Αίοιι by Rheede, although
these send 10015 from their branchos.

Plukenct after Ray calls this plant Ficus Malalmrica, fructu
Ribesie'ttbrma et magnitmline, Tsiela (licta (illm. 145), and com-
pares it to the Arbor Symphoro Caryoplzylli aromatici foliis et
facie Jamaicensis (Almus), Of which a figure is given in the
Plzgstograplcia (t. 266. f. 1.). Plukenet, however, merely com-
pares the plants, and by 110 means says that they are the same.
He adds in 11 concluding sentence, that from its branches it
sends down fibres, which take root : but it is not perfectly clear
whether he means this to apply to the Tsiela or to the plant of
Jamaica. If he meant the former, 116 was misinformed, 115
Rheede does not say 11 word of such 11 61161111151111166; and all
persons whom I consulted agreed in denying its taking place.
Plukenct himself seems to 1111116 been sensible of some error
here3 for in the mantissa, 75, he considers the Tsjela as pro-
bably being the Ficus Indica Mali Limoniae solio, subtus canes-
