‘288 slsr. Vloons's aml Dr. HORSPIELD'S Description of tlze

ders this singular deviation from the general form of the Parrot's
tongue less surprising. Our characters of the tongue are drawn
from a specimen belonging to a species of this genus, which was
sor some time alive in this country: and our inferences con—
cerning its 1156 are strongly confirmed by the observations of
Mr. Caley on the manners of some species, extracts from which
will accompany our descriptions of the birds. It is to be re-
inarked, that although the Parrots are in general a long-lived
racc, and of all birds perhaps the most easily reared, and
although 1116 birds of the present group are most numerous in
New llolland, few of them have been kept alive for any length
of time in a state os confineinent. Ignorance most probably
of their natural mode of feeding has occasioned this difficulty in
rearing 1116111.

We, have reason to believe that the next adjoining group of
1116 present subfamily, the genus Lurius of the Eastern Islands,
is endowed with a similar formation of tongue. These two
united groups include some of the birds which exhibit the most
elongated and the wcakest bills in the family ι and the deviation
evinced from the general mode of feeding of the family confirms
our conjectures that the birds which are distinguished by such
characters of the bill are the most aberrant in the group3 while
1116 birds which possess the opposite characters, viz. strength
and shortness of bill, are the most typical. It is also to be
observed, that the next allied group of the Order of 1113635016»-
which adjoins the Parrots, and to which the two aberrant genera
at present before us approach most nearly of all that family, is
distinguished by the tongue entirely superseding the general
functions ot' the bill in procuring sustenance. The partial use
of the tongue in these two genera of Psittaciclce, thus affords an
addition to the numberless beautiful instances in which nature
blends together the characters of her conterminous groups.
