ripe seed in a cell have not hitherto been observed in either of
the described species.

The remarkable character of multifid and intricately folded
cotyledons‚ which will be noticed, recurs in certain other plants
os the same natural order, and especially in one which it is my
purpose to describe in this essay, and which exhibits three-lobed
eontortuplicate cotyledons. It was first delineated solely from
the flower: the fruit not having ripened on the trees where Ι
observed the blossom. Dr. &Vallicln having been inore fortunate
than 1113156111Ί in this respect, has since furnished me with a par-
ticular description of the ripe fruit, and has proposed the name
of Burseni serrata formy plant. I had taken it„ while unac-
‹1uainted with its fruit, for an Ailantlms.

lt certainly is akin to the illarignia of Commerson, which
Lamarck introduced into the genus Rumor-a, with the specific
name of omns-{foliaff-2: and which his continuator Poiret in one
place remarks to have much affinity with Gaertner's Damnem-ct,
and in another says it appears to be the saniei.

Gaertner himself, identifying his plant, of which the specimen
was received from the Isle of hlauritius, with the Damnum-a ηἰ-
gra of Rumphius, indigenous in the Molucca Isi-ands, remarked
its near affinity to slnzyris, and thought it possibly a genuine
species of that genus} But, it has the intricate foldings of the
cotyledons which are remarked in But-sera serrata.

As the two genera of Amyris and Burs-era are at present con-
stituted, a botanist may well be still at a, loss to which of them a
new plant of the family is to be referred. The variable. features
of But-sera gummffera, and the early inaccurate descriptions of
it, have led systematic writers to assign an essenti-al character to
the genus constructed on its type, which is very loose and uncer-
