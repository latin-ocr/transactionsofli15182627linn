Τ116 Crested Pintado of Africa, the Numida cristata of Pallas,
described and figured in Dr. Latham's Gener-al Synopsis, vol. ir.
p. 638, and in his General Ilistory, vol. viii. p. 148, exhibits
11]] extraordinary structure, to which I shall first advert. That
part of the ns furcula, or inerrythought as it is more commonly
called, which in our common Guinea Fowl consists of 11 single 11111
11111(16 descending from the apex or junction of the two branches‚
is 11] this bird double, one side appearing to extend from each
branch; it is also somewhat circular, and united 111 1116 edges
throughout the greater part of the circuinference‚ forming 11
socket or pouch. 'l'he 1111611611, quitting the neck of 1116 bird 111
1116 lower curve of the cervical vertebrae, posses downward be-
tween the branches of the furcula, enters the pouch 111 1116 lower
part of the orifice, traverses 1116 inner surface, and issuing from
the upper part, rises with 11 circular sweep, upward and forwurd
to the projecting anterior portion of the sternum, over which 11
turns backward to pass into the body; guided in its course by
two semi-trunsparent niembraneS, stretching from this projection
of the sternuni to the head of 611011 clavicle.

If 11 11116 116 drawn from the connnencement of the 1111611611, as
shown in the figure, to the bronchia, passing between the sca-
pulae, it will describe the situation of the trachea in our common
domestic Guinea Fowl, and the variation of the crested bird will
appear the more extraordinary by comparison.

For the opportunity of figuring this singular structure, l 11111
indebted to the 1111613111)ν of the Board of Curators of the Royal
College of Surgeons, and to the friendship of Mr. W. Chst, ι11111,
for 11 beautiful drawing fron] 11 specimen in the Museuni of 1116
00116516, 1116 only one Ι ever had 111] opportunity of examining.
From 111111 drawing the one now annexed is a close copy.

M. Temminck has described this bird in his Histoire Nata-
relle (ῗίνιέναῖσ cles Pigeons et (les Θαίῖὶηασέε, vol. ii. p. 443,
