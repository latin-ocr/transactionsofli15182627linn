genus as t1·ime1·0us³·*'<. And the fact is, that this truly tetra—
merous structure prevails‚ as far as I have observed‚ throughout
all the insects hitherto called trimerous : for instance, in Eumor-
Jffzus immarginatus, a. Sumatran 1115661, which I more particularly
specify, for the same reason as the J avanese Coccinclla‚ because
they are both large species in a group of which the insects are
generally small, and because the tetramerous structure of their
tarsus is therefore visible to the naked eye.

These very remarkable facts desti-oy even the very nomencla-
ture of M. Latreille's system, and throw doubt on the description
of almost every genus that is not recorded as pentamerous in
the Genera Ins-cetorum. In this stage of the investigation, there-
fore, two important questions arise, which require much 111011·
development than I am able to give them in the present crude
sketch. These are, first, What coleopterous genera possess only
four ι1011115 to each of their tarsi ἲ and, secondly, Considering such
tetramerous tarsi as typically pentamerous, what articulation is 11
111111 15 evanescent in these genera ἶ Such are questions intimately
connected with the doctrine of natural affinities‚ as it 16111165 to
Colcoptera; and I therefore beg leave to conclude this paper
with a few remarks, which may be interesting to those who may
be inclined to take up the subject.

Heteromerous insects 1116, as before said, so called by MM. Du-
meril and Latreille because they have five articulations to each os
the four first tarsi, and only four to each of the two last. This, as
