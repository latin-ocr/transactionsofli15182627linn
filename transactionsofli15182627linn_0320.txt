feathers. The group which we have just characterized deviates
from these characters, which may be considered typical in the
family, by the greater strength of all these members. The bill
is powerfnl, the under mandible more particularly, which is
marked by a strong ascending gonys. The nostrils are wide and
ovaL and covered only on the upper part by a membrane. The
tarsi and feet are particularly strong: the former are much
compresscd on the external side, exhibiting by this conforma-
tion a nearly flattened surface in front. The wings also are
much rounded, and comparatively shorter than in the typical
Cnclsoos. In many of these particulars the group agrees very
nearly with the neighbouring genera Cena-opus, lll.‚ and Plzceni-
coplzaus, V ieill.‚ which have equally been separated from the
typica] species of the family. But it may at once be distin-
guished from Centropus by the absence of the lengthened nail
to the hallas,- and it will be seen equally to differ from Plzcenico-
phalas· in its stronger, shorter and less arcuated bill; in the
wings being longer, and the tail rounded, not graduated. The
compressed formation of the sides of the tarsi in our group is
also wanting in Phoenic-opham. The species of this genus seem
very widely distributed over the East. The cuculus pmzctatus,
Linn.‚ the Coucou taclzetb cles [mles orientales (Pl. Enl. 771),
appears to be referable to this group.
