Tun various ‹lualities and powers of voice exhibited by birds
in general, and the diversity of structure known to exist in the
tracheae or windpipes of different species in some particular
samilies, have justly excited the attention and remarks of several
writers. Dr. Latliam, in the 4th volume of the Transactions of
this Society, has furnished descriptions and illustrations of the
peculiarities of this part in some of those species most remark-
able for their deviation from the connnon form ; and to his paper
l shall occasionally take the liberty to refer.

To other sources ornithologists are indebted for delineations
not included in the essay before mentioned: and the present
communication‚ accompanied by drawings of several tracheze
not hitherto tigurech will, 1 trust, be considered an acceptable
addition on this interesting subject.

The peculiarities in the form, as well as in the composition‚ ot*
the several parts of the windpipes of birds, having already been
described under the different names of the glottis, or superior
larynx: the tube3 the bone of divarication, with its cross-bone
forming the lower end of the tube; and lastly‚ the bronchia, by
which the bone of divarication is connected with the lungs ;——I
shall proceed at once to the descriptions of those new forms of
tracheae which are the subject of the present communication.
