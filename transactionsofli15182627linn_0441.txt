to my former theory. The possession at length of a specimen
of the same species, in which the sternum was uninjured, con-
firmed its truth, however, by exhibiting a perfect land Tortoise
with the anterior lobe of the sternum moveable, and capable of
as accurately closing¹ the shell, as in any species of the fresh-
water Box Tortoises.

This peculiarity, so unexpected in the Land Tortoises, ap-
pears to be sufficiently important, connected as it is with a
remarkable modification of the muscular system, to require a
distinct generic appellation‚ which I propose to supply hythe
name PYxis.

The importance of such species as form a passage from 0116
group to another, and the affinities of which serve 10 indicate
the relations whereby the different groups are connected, will
perhaps be a sufficient excuse for my having dwelt so long on
the minute circumstances connected with the history of those
species which form the subject of this paper; especially when it
is considered, that in the present instance they fill up a hiatus
which has long interfered with a perfect knowledge of the na—
tural arrangement of the order.
