Australian Bircls in tlze Collection of tlte Limzcan Sociclgs. 209

In Dr. Latham's first description* of his ssIerops ονηαίιιε, 3
New Holland species of this genus not in the Society's collec-
tion, a bird is alluded 10, which was figured in ΜΓ. Lainbert’s
collection of drawings, and whose characters nearly accord.
with the bird before us. Dr. Latham conjectures it to be the
female of M. ornatus. In the second edition of his work'l, he
repeats the same observation, 11111 (1005 1101 refer to the speci-
1110115 111 1110 Society's museum. One of the birds, however, in
the collection is a male, as we find recorded in Mr. Caley's
notes. Dr. Latham's conjecture respecting sex consequently
proves erroneous. And the two specimens from which our above
description is taken, according in every particular with each
other, and exhibiting a fine state of preservation, are so distinct
from ΙΙΙ. ornatas, that we cannot consider ourselves authorised
to come 31 once to the conclusion that they are varieties of 11131
species. The 1311 111 0111 bird is black, which in Μ. ornalus is
chestnut; and the fore part of the head is of the same colour as
the back, while in Dr. Lathain's bird 11 15 (11111 orange ἶ Both
these species differ from the ssl- viridis of Linnaeus by their

and by having 3 conspicuous longitudinal streak of 113111 111110
immediately under 1110 black band that passes beneath the eye.
The rectrices also of the Indiam Bee-Eater are green above, while
in 1110 other two species they are either black or chestnut.

Mr. Caley informs us, that 1110 specimens in the Society's
collection were 1110113111 10 111111 (103(1 ; 110 never had an oppor-

ss The. bird which ΜΓ. Lewin has figured in 1115 “ Birds ofNew Holland’' (pl. 2.),

and which he 1135 referred to Dr. Latlmm's BIerops ornatus, seems rather to belong to

our species.
