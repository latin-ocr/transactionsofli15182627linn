extensive orders and genera into sections cannot, I think, be
doubted.

ln concluding this part of my subject, I beg leave to otl'er a
few remarks on the use of the ternis conlmzry and parallel as
applied to the position of the dissepiment of bilocular fruits; as
without such explanation, that part of the following description
which relates to the position of the dissepiment would be lialile
to be misunderstood. I use the term dissepimentum contrarium
to express such dissepiments as have their flat side facing the
stem, or, inore properly speaking, contrary to the axis of the
flower, without regard to the compression of the valves ; and (lis-
sepimentmn parallelum, to denote such as are perpendicular to the
axis of the (lower, having their edge opposed to the stem. 'l'he
distinction between the parallel and contrary dissepiment having
been hitherto so vague and uncertain, the adoption of the pre-
ceding mode os applying the terms will be found very advan-
tageous. ln order to point out more clearly the inconvenience,
if not absurdity, of the manner in which these ternis have been
hitherto applied, I need only mention, that in the greater part ot'
Scropltularinae the dissepiinent is said to be parallel, and contrary
in Pedii-alaris and some other genera, merely because the valves
happen to be more compressed: for the fact is, its position is
precisely similar. In all bilocular fruits having really a parallel
septum, the dehiscence takes place at the margin of the valves.

*t l have found it necessary to modify in some degree the character of the sectiony
from obserring the differences assumed by the seeds of certain species of Linaria.
