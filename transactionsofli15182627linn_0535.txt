ferences. Thus botanists speak of certain species ofplants dif-
fering in appearance, babit, touch, &c.; by which they often
mean that they have some indescribable peculiarities about them,
which point them out. to the practised observer as distinct. A
great number of such species may be detected in every modern
Flora of a well investigated country ; but whether they deserve
to be ranked among 111056 which are capable of definition, is a
question of great doubt z—that the practice 15 1111 inconvenience,

in inextricable difficulty all our well known species, make us
dependent upon empirical and traditional evidence for our ac-
quaintance with them, and render it impossible to derive instruc-
tion from books. In such cases the assumed law ought to be

Many of our cultivated plants also tend to invalidate the law.

are there, of which the astutest botanist can trace the origin!
Domesticated animals afford a still more striking example;
and 1111111 himself furnishes the most difficult problem of all.
These remarks and examples are, I apprehend, sufficient to
show how difficult it 15 10 adopt the term in its strict acceptation ς

that it 61111 only be taken as correct 111 a vague and general sense,

The next term of importance to the naturalist upon which the
accuracy of his reasoning depends, is that division of 1115 system
which he denominates 11 Genus. This is an assemblage of 111-

dividuals agreeing also in some common characters ; but, unlike
