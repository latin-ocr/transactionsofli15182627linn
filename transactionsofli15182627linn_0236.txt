and the first almost spurious. The tail is long and graduated,
which in the true leruslzes is even ; and the scales 011 1116 uero-
tarsiu are strongly conspicuous, while the tarsa· of the Thy-ashes
are entire.

The genus appears very nearly allied to Timalia, Horsf., in
its general conformation. But it does not possess the elevated
culmen of 1116. bill so conspicuous in that group; nor is the dis-
position of the quill-feathers the same. In these respects Timalia
comes nearer to Turdus, Auct. The tarsa? of our genus appear
somewhat more elevated than is usual in this family; and from
what ΜΓ. Caley says of the habits of the birds which compose the
type of the group, we conjecture that they indicate the approach
of the present subfamily to the Roclc and Ground Τὴν-1151163, which
form the next succeeding divisions of the extensive group of
Merululae.

Mr. Caley says, that 1116 weight of the male was 4 ounces. He
adds: “This species is by no means plentifully to be met with.
It inhabits the small forest scrubs, and is frequently started from
the ground. It appears to be more constantly on the ground
than in the trees, taking a short ssight on being disturbed, and
then again alighting on the ground a little further off.”
