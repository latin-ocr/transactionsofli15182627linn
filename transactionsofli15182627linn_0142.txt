130 Dr. FRANCIS HAMILTON’S Commentary

seen. M. Poiret (Eue. Melle. iv. 4163 Sap. iv. 56 ) it must be
allowed makes 110 distinction. The plant 01 Dr. Roxburgh

ever saw that of Rheede I know 1101, but he does not quote 1119

In my Commentary on the great work 01 Rumphius (Herb.
Amo. i. 177.) I have said all that seems necessary on this sub-
ject.

ITT1 Ama ALou, p.69. t, 55.

Commeline justly considered this as a Ficus. The Malabar
name implies that the 1199 15 011 Are Alozt (Ficus religiosa, Lin.
Trans. xiii. 487), having a resemblance to 1119 [tti or Iti-ts Αίοιι
(Ibid. 486), which is perhaps the ficus Betgjamina of M. La-
marck (Eric. Illez‘lz. ii. 493). The generic name Goli, given to
this 1199 05 well as 10 1119 Itti Alon by the Brahmans 01 Malabar,
is probably the same with the Gular 01 1119 Ilindwi dialect, given
to several Fici. The word Douadelce prefixed seems to imply
that its branches abound with milky juice.

Rumphius at first (Herb. Amb. iii. 140.) confounded the Itty
Αἷοιι with 1115 faringa parvgfhlicm but, as I have mentioned in
treating of that plant, this was an error: the Itty Alozc bearing its
figs on smum, while those of 1119 Varinga parvq'f'olia are 5955119;
and, in fact, Rumphius was afterwards (Appeml. iii. 142.) sen-
sible that he should have quoted the Illi Are Aloa. On this
account I should have considered Burman correct in quoting
the Itti Are Alma (by the Latin name 01 Comnieline) for the
faringa parvzfolia (Hei-l). Amb. iii. 142. in lahulae erplctnatioue),
were it not that Rumphius says, “ fructus formam Grossulorum
referentes, inferius nempe angustati, superius rotundi,'’ which in
the Linnaean language would be ‘fi-nctus obovati,· while Rheede
