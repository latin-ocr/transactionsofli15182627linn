‘⁶ This bird,'' says ΜΓ. Caley, ‘⁴ which the settlers call Bal-hill,
is gregarious, and appears at times in very large fiocks. Ι have
killed above forty at a shot. They frequently visited my garden
in the winter to feed on a species of grass-seed.’'

Fam. STUR N [Diri.

We have introduced the mention of this family for the pur-
pose of stating the great deticiency‚ if not total want of the
birds belonging to it, which prevails in New Holland. In the
continents of the Old and New World the Sim-uidae congre-
gate in large fiocks, and follow the herds of the larger herbivo-
rous sslammalia, from whom they obtain a great portion of their
⁴nourishment, collecting the insects with which they abound,
and the remains of the herbaceous food which are found in
their neighbourhood. The general want of these herbivorous
Quaclrupecls in Ausa-alia, accounts for a corresponding deficiency
in those birds which look to them for a chief portion of their
support. A similar deficiency in the Coproplmgons insects has
been equally observed* in the same country, and a similar
cause assigned for it. A species however of the family is now
before us, which has been for some time included in our New
Holland collection. It bears no note of whence it came, nor
any donor's name 3 and we have some doubts whether it might
not have crept into the collection by mistake. As we have
been particularly guarded against introducing any species which
has not come to the Society from an authentic source, wc
refrain from giving it as a New IIolland bird, but shall merely
