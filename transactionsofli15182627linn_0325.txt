their food, unlike that of the other flamines, is represented as
being exclusively on the wing. By the brilliancy again, and
varying lustre of their colours, these “ gay creatures of the ele-
ment'’ evince their separation from the neighbouring groups,
and indeed from every other race of birds, of which the manners
are less aerial than their own, and the food less sublimated than
the nectar of flowers.

In the New World again, a third group appears, the family
of Nectariniadoe, in which a comparative strength of bill and legs
is exhibited, nearly equal to that which is found in many of the
more typical species of the Insessorcs. The wings are generally
shorter than those of the Cinnyridae, and differ in their structure
also from them, the first quill—feather being long, almost equalling
the second in length, while that of the Old world family is short,
and, as before observed, nearly spurious. The tail in all the spe-
cies we have met with is even. These birds, distinguished by
their stronger conformation from those of the Narmal Group, are
distinguished also by their habits. They do not feed exclusively
on the using, but explore the nectaries of fiowers as they hop
from branch to branehr. By their colours also they may be set
apart from the typical families. These, although in most spe-
eies bright and vivid, are decided colours‚ and not changeable in
different lights.

In addition to these groups Australia furnishes another im-
portant accession to the Tenuirostres. No species of the before-
mentioned groups has hitherto been found in that country; and
their place seems to be occupied by a group of considerable
extent, which preserve the same habits of feeding on vegetable
juices, but deviate from the typical character of the Tribe even
still further than the Nectariniadae. In the birds to which I
allude, or the family of lllelffllzagidae, the wings and tail show
an evident deficiency in the powers of ssight, compared with
