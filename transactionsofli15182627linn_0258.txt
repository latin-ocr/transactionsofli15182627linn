‘⁶ This birdj’ Mr. Caley says, ‘⁶ is called yellow Robin by the
colonists. It is an inhabitant of brushes.’' A bird in the col-
lection, which has in every respect the appearance of the present
species, with the exception of the throat being whitish instead
of yellow, was met with by Mr. Brown on the South coast. It
is probably the young of the species

The two last species deviate considerably in the form of their
bills from the other species of this genus. These members are
much more slender and less arched at the culmen than in the
typical birds. In other characters the two species sufficiently
accord with the group. We leave them at the extremity of it
for the present, not being willing to speak too decisively on a
subject in which our materials are scanty and not in the best
order for examination. The two species evince a very strong
approximation to the illascicapidae.

Fam. MUSCICAPIDAE.

Genus. MUSCICAPA. Linn. et Auct.

[f we select the illuscicapa atricapz'lla of Linnaeus as the type
of the extensive family of M uscicapiclae, and the representative
of the true Muscicapa,—an arrangement, which froin our fami-
liarity with the species, and from its exhibiting characters the
most remote from those of all the neighbouring groups, appears
to be the most expedient,—little deviation will be found to exist
between some of the Australian species of the family and the
European type. The three following species belonging to the
