same time; and that the egg being hatehed, the young grub
insinuates itself into, and finally through the skin, forming an
abscess beneath it. In a somewhat similar manner it is that the
ichneumon flies deposit their eggs on the sides of living cater-
pillars of the Lepidoptera, and hatching, perforate their skins,
and entering within, live on the parenchyma or pulp of their
bodies till matured and fully grown, when they make their way
out again and change to the clirysalis.

I may also remark of the (Eslri, that they appear to be won-
derfully kept from such an increase as would be fatal to the
animals they feed upon, by the difficulties and imminent hazards
they are exposed to in the aet of depositing their eggS. The
teeth of the horse must destroy, one should imagine, nine—tenths
of the (Ε. Equi, lz<mom-leoidalis, and salullferus. The (Estri seem
however, in the hands of Providenee, to make a double recom-
pense for the sufferings they oceasi0n3 first, by keeping the
animals on the alert during hot weather, when they would be
often too idly disposed for their welfare; while the few larvae
which suceeed in getting into their bodies, appear to benefit
them by their local irritations, stimulating the stomach to a
quieker digestion of their watery food, and diverting diseases by
their eounter irritations of the skin and frontal eavities,—thus
producing the effect of issues or vesieatories, which are powerful
remedies in relieving and in preventing diseases.

Ι apprehend that Ι have now sufficiently shown that the
OEstrus of the aneients could have been no Tabam, and that
it is clear Olivier, who appears to have originated this notion,
and who was followed by Latreille, was mistaken.

A very extensive enumeration of this genus is seen in a late
ingenious publication, the Systemalisclze Besclzrcibzmg of J. W.
Meigen. It is however in some instanees not correct; for on
caresully examining the OEstrus lineatus of this writer, intro-
