it with any other. The elder Burman by a very rude classifica-
tion calls the Neli' Pouli, Malus indica fructu parvo, rotundo,
acido, striato; and notices that the Ceylonese call it Nelli, the
same name that is given to the Plzgyllanllms Emblica, a resem-
blance to which has been already mentioned.

Linnaeus‚ in the Flora ,Zegslanicm 179, returned to the error of
Rheede and Ray in classing it with the Bilimbi, and called it
Averrleoa rantis nudis frnctgfficantibus, pomis subrotumlis: and
when he gave specific names, the Noli I'ouli was calleci Averrlzoa
acida (Bm-m. Fl. Iud. 106.), although it is less acid than either
of the other plants with which it was then classed. In the
Mantissa, 1⁶24, Linnaeus described 3 plant called Cicca disticha,
which, he says, has a capsular fruit; and which therefore may

alleged (Suppl. 416.) that the Cicca disticha and Averrlzoa acida
are 1116 531116; and such is now the general opinion among
botanists (U'illcl. Sp. Pl. iv. 332. Ilort. Kew. v. 258. Lamarclc
Ill. Gen. t. 757. f. 1.), although M.La1narck (Enc. Metlz. ii. 1.)
points out the difficulty which I have mentioned. XVhether or
not deterred by this, or whether attracted by the resemblance to
the Pligsllantlius Emhlica, Dr. Roxburgh (Ilort. Beng. 69.) quotes
the Mle? Poulzt for his I'lzyllantlzus l011g·{f0lins.· but l here suspect
some mistake3 for he says that its Bengalese name is Lodlz,
which is 3 plant used in (lycing, and never, so far as Ι know,
applied to the Cher-anicla.- besides, he has also a Plzgyllcmtlms
Cher-amsla (IJort. Beng. 104), to which, I suspect, the quotation
from the Hortus M alahor-icus should have belonged.

In the Rungpur district I have found 3 plant with leaves very
like the Neli Pouli, which Ι suspect belongs to the real genus
cioca, as described by the elder Linnaeus, and to which the
Cicca congesta of Lamarck probably should be referred, but
