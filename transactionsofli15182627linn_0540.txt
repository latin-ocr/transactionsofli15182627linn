distinct 8611115, marked 1101 only by its general habit or aspect,
its uses and qualities, hut also by essential characters in its teeth‚
hoofs, and internal constituti0n.'' It was the. circumscribing
these insulated assemblages of species that Linnaeus regarded as
the business of the accomplished naturalist.

Those therefore who use the word genus in the Linnoean 561156,
do not employ it with the same meaning as those who regard
genera as merely conventional‚ and subject to be broken down
to suit convenience. 'she latter would (10 well to employ some
other term, else one great object will be lost 111 which we are
aiming ;—the keeping together under some one common head
those small assemblages of species which in some 111511111065 are
50 obvious, and 50 important in enabling 115 10 comprehend and
discourse of the scheme of nature.

Ἴεῐ1111611161· such insulated groupings really exist, it is for the
naturalist to determine, and this 01111 be only inferred from a very
extensive knowledge; but as long as we are witnesses 10 511011
striking modifications of form as we discover in the genus Erico,
Rosa, Eriocaulw, &c.‚ among plants, and in l'espc‘rtilm, Stra,
,scca-absens, &C., among animals, it would be the height of folly
10 give up 11 term 50 expressive and at the same time 50 usefal,
or to transfer its received meaning to some other word which 11115
1101 been used in the same sense.

As the success of the systematist depends 50 materially upon
the proper 1156 of these 1111511110110115, Ι 5111111 now proceed 10 show
some distinctions which it 15 necessary 10 keep in view while we
employ them. We aim, as I said before, at two distinct objects
by 1116 1156 of systems: we use the artificial for becoming ac-
quainted with individuals, and the natural as 1116 means of com-
bining them, and enabling the student to comprehend and speak
of the general truths relating 10 nature by a knowledge of a few
particulars.
