comparatively still air of a room without tire, both the lines and
webs descend slowly to the fioor, the latter falling with the
greater degree of velocity.

Were these productions lighter than atmospheric air, or were
the spiders capable of effecting an ascent without the help of
adventitious aid, a calm though cloudy day might answer their
purpose3 but as considerable warmth is required to produce an
ascending current of raretied air strong enough to bear them
from the earth, av bright as well as still day is indispensable.

Founded on results obtained from an experiment which has
been frequently made, but never conducted with sufficient care,
is the belief entertained by many eminent entomologists that
spiders can forcibly propel or dart out threads from their papillae.
Now as this process would, contrary to my own experience‚ im-
ply the exercise of a physica] power peculi-ar to these creatures ;
and as attempts have been made to explain on this principle the
fabrication of their webs in situations where their ordinary mode
of proceeding could not be employed, I determined to repeat
the experimenti from which so strange a conclusion has been
deduced. With this view, having procured a small branched
twig, I fixed it upright in an earthen vessel containing water, its
base being immersed in the liquid, and upon it Ι placed several
of the spiders which produce gossamer. Whenever the insects·
thus circumstanced were exposed to a current of air, either
naturally or artificially produced, they directly turned the thorax
towards the quarter whence it came, even when it was so slight
as scarcely to be perceptible, and elevating the abdomen, they
emitted from their spinners a small portion of glutinous matter,
which was instantly carried out in a line, consisting of four finer
ones, with a velocity equal‚ or nearly so, to that with which the
air moved, as was apparent srom observations made on the mo-
tion of detached lines similarly exposed. The spidem, in the
