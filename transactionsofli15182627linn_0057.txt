give the bird a surer footing when wading upon soft mud. Ι 11
consequence of this structure, the inner toes of each foot must
necessarily sink deeper than the outer 01105, and secure the bird
from all danger of falling over on either side.

2. Τ. Caliclris (Redshank‚ Red-legs).

A specimen of this bird, examined April QSth, varied from
the descriptions given by Linnaeus and Montagu. The base of
the lower mandible only was red; the coverts of the primaries
were purplish on their outer webs, and dusky black on their
inner. Montagu says “ the secondaries are tipped with white ;“’
111 1110 above specimen they were more than half white.

The Redshank is found in considerable numbers in many of
the marshes both of Norfolk and Suffolk during the breeding
season. It is indeed more common than any other kind of
wader. To sportsmen it is very troublesome, fiying around
them and uttering an incessant shrill whistle‚ which alarms all the
birds near the spot. A few Redshanks are sometimes met with
during the winter season‚ but the greater part of them migrate.
This species is found solitary and also in fiocks on the ooze of
the river Stour. The ordinary posture of the young Redshank
is with the head sunl< back between the shoulders‚ the back of
the neck being void of feathers, like that of the Bittern.

3. Τ. Oclzropus (Green Sandpiper).

We cannot positively affirm that this species breeds here,
though it seems probable that it sometimes does 50, as five
Green Sandpipers were constantly found one summer near the
old decoy at Levington in Suffolk. It is seen in these 0011111105

throughout 1110 winter.
