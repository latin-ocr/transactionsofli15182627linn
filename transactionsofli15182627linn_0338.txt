Mr. Caley informs us that he called ‘⁶ this bird Coolcaycoclc,
from its uttering a sound like that word. ’1116 natives call it
Colce’ran. It now and then may be seen in 1116 scrubs about
Paramatta, always on trees ; but it is common in the neighbour-
hood of Sydney. It is what I should call an inhabitant of 1116
coast. Ι have met with it at NVestern Port.'’

²* We take 11115 opportunity of characterizing 1116 following bird, which has been
generally comidered tho young oftsslnllzs. caram-ulae«, but which appears to 115 tn be
distinct. Resides some strong marks of difference in the colours of the two birds,
which appear too deeided to indicate the dlfforence merely of age, the shape of the
caruncle affords a strong ground for separation. In our bird 11115 appendnge to the
cheeks is short, ssat, compresse(l‚ and suboval. 111 ΑηίΙι. carunculam it is long, nar-
row and cylimlric. The dill'erenee between the two birds is· much too great to allow
us to refer 1116111 10 one species, without authentic proof of their identity. Onr bird
resctnblcs. 1116 description of Illerops clzlysopterus, Latl1.; but that bird 15 said to have
no caruncle on 1116 61166115, and 10 have the markings on 1116 wings of a goldcn-01 ange
colour.
