of tlte Nor-folle ancl Slgffollc Birds. 3

spread in a meadow, and fastened at the corners with little hooked
sticks. On the middle of the napkin a live sparrow was tixed by
means of a string three or four inches in length. Slender twigs
were stuck up on both sides the eloth, to prevent the Ilawk
from attacking the sparrow on either side. Two long slender
twigs of weeping-willow, well covered with birdliine, were stuck
in the ground, one at each end ot' the napkin‚ both forming an
arch over the bird, but at such a distance that the sparrow
could not touch them with its wings whilst fluttering; neither
could any Ilawk reach the sparrow without coming in contact
with the limed twigs. The intention of the white eloth was to
attract the attention of the Hawk at a greater distance to the
sparrow fluttering upon it. The limed twigs were stuck so
slightly in the ground, that if the IIawk‚ upon finding himself
entangled, should struggle, they would have gone off with him
and prevented his fliglit. Mr. ΙΙ. observes, that twigs covered
with birdli1ne‚ when long and slender‚ will stop the fiight of the
strongest bird, if fixed so as to pass off with him, when touched
by his plumage ; for they then become like a chain binding the
wings to tlie body. By these twigs he lias caught the Cuckoo‚
Pigeon, &c., and has no doubt but that the Eagle, and every
bird of prey, might be taken by them when their nests or haunts
are discovered.

The disposition of the Kestril is bold and familiar. Imme-
diately upon the capture of one by the above method‚ Mr. Har-
rison placed him upon a table, and gave him the spari-ow which
he had killed when taken: he plucked and ate it in his pre-
sence, showing no more dread than if he had been brought up
tame. After capturing three of these birds, Mr. H. made no
further attempts upon them, as he considers them to be of great
benefit to the farmer, and doing very little injury to the sports-
man.
