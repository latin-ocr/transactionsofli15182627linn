usually the character of those birds, that we have much doubt
as to the actual situation of our group.

Mr. Cnley has the following observations on these birds.
‘⁶ Erum—A very common bird about Paramatta, called by the
natives Coldong’.—It repe-<its the words ‘ poor soldier' and
‘ four o'clock' very distinctly—-I have frequently seen three or
four of them flying after a hawk, which they seeined desimus of
attacking. It is a strong and sharp-clawed bird.’'

U'e have some doubt whether our bird 15 the same as Dr. La-
tham's speciem or whether both may not be the young of the
Trop. corniculutus. 'Phe specimen in our collection differs from
that species by being snmller; by the top of the head being
covered with short downy white feathers instead of being en-
tirely bare; by the knob of the base of the bill being less ele-

vate-d ;
