For what I have to say concerning this tree I may in a great
measure refer to my Commentary on the first volume of the
Herhariam Amboinense, the Jaca. being identically the same with
the Saccus arboreus major of Rumphius. With this author one
might be inclined to think that ngjalca or Jaca are derived from
the Dutch word zak, signifying a sack‚—t.lie fruit resembling a
bag filled with seeds ; for the tree or fruit is by 110 means called
Jalca in the Hindustani language, as Rumphius supposed : but
in that dialect it is called Κακία] and Panas, from Panasa of
the sacred language3 and this is the same word with Ponossou,
which according to Rheede is used by the Brahmans of Mala-
bar. Pilau is therefore perhaps the proper Malabar name ’ἲ lt
must however be observed‚ that 1119 natives of Malabar have
another tree called Kalon Tsjalca (Hert. Mal. iii. Ω .), or the
wild Tsjak(1‚ which has some resemblance to the Tfjalsa or Arto-
carpus integrisblia; but its fruit does not resemble a sack : and
this would seem to show that Tsjalca is a generic word not
derived from the Dutch. By the Burmas this tree is called
Pi-naelz.

Am MARAM, J). 21. tab. 99.

In my Commentary on the Herlmriam Amhoinense (i. 138.) I
have said what occurs to me concerning this plant. The names
Ata and Atoa, in general use over India, seem to be derived
from the Aias of the Portuguese, by whom probably this fine
fruit was introduced into India.
