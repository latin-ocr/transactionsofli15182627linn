observation. 'l'here is a considerable difference in the clavicles.
in the Pongo they are much straighter aud of a different form,
as was particularly observable in a specimen belonging to that
kind and munificent promoter of natural 50101100, 1110 late Sir
‚stamford Raffles. 'l'he scapulae of the Pongo have their spine
strongly incurvated upwards‚ while in the Simia Satyrus it pur-
sues almost a straight direction horizontally ι 1110 space also for
the attachment of the infra spinatus muscle 15, relatively to the

the form of the skull, there are differences between these animals
so decided as particularly to claim our attention, especially as I
am not aware that they have been before noticed. The nasal
bones in both animals are perfectly flat and do not at all project
forwards, and are ossified together at a very early age 2 but the

in the Satyrus than in the Pongo, where 11. can be hardly said to
exist at all‚-—a circumstance which, supposing the latter to be
the adult Satyrus, is the reverse of what takes place in other
animals. But the most distinguishing difference relates to the
proportions of the orbits, and the space which separates them.
'i'hey are of by far the greatest proportionate size in the Salmas,-
for in the very young animal before alluded to, they measure
transversely 15 lines and a half, while in the skull of the largest
Pongo ever brought to this country, they extend no more than
17 lines and a half. But the difference in the extentos the space
between the orbits 15 of all the distinctions I have seen the most
apparent: for in the Satyrus„ where the transverse extent of the
orbits is 15 111105 and a half, and the vertical 17 and a half, the
space between the orbits is only Ω 111105 and a l1alf; and in the.
still younger Satyrus at the Royal Institution, where the trans-
verse dianieter is 13 lines and a half, this space measures only
⁴2 lines. or less than one-sixth : while in the Pongo, where the
