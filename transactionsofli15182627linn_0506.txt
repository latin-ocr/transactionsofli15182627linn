456 Mr. BLACKwALL’s Observations to ascertain

next place, carefully ascertained whether their lines had become
firmly attached to any object or not, by pulling at them with
the first pair of legs; and if the result was satisfactory, after
tightening them sufficiently they made them fast to the twig3
then discharging from their spinners, which they applied to the
spot where they stood, a little more of their liquid gum, and
committing themselves to these bridges of their own construct-
ing, they passed over them in safety, drawing a second line after
them as a security 111 case the first gave way, and so effected
their escape.

Such was invariably the result when the spiders were placed
where the air was liable to be sensibly agitated: I resolved
therefore to put a bell-glass over them; and in this situation
they rcmained seventeen days, evidently unable to produce a
single line by which they could quit the branch they occupied
without eneountering the water at its base; though on the re-
moval of the glass they regained their liberty with as much
celerity as in the instances already recorded.

This experiment, which from a want of due precaution in its
management has misled so many distinguished naturalists, Ι
have tried with several of the geometric spiders, and always
with the same success. Placed under the bell-glass, or in any
close vessel, they in vain endeavoured to make their escape
from the hranch to which they were confined: but in the dis-
turbed air of an inhabited room they readily accomplished their
object.

lnstances of long-sustained abstinence from food by insects of
the genus Arane«, unaccompanied by any manifest diminution of
vital energy, have been given by various observers. In adding
another case to the list it is proper to remark, that it must be
received solely on my own authority.

Some of the spiders which produce gossamer were procured
