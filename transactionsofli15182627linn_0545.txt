Plantas defining the last thus, “ Plantae dicuntur reliquae, qua·
priores intrare nequeunt familias.'' Phil. Bot. §78 'Pake up
Jussieu’s ‘⁶ Genera Pl(mtc11·1cm;'' and besides his ‘⁵ Plantae incerta*
sedis‚'' see how he is obliged to dispose at the end of many or-
ders his ‘⁶ Genera affinia‚'' and ‘⁶ Genera nondum satis determi-
nata.” This is true inductive philosophy; yet the same author
may be suspected of departing from this mode of investigation
when he attempts to edge in his remainder under artificial or
sweeping characters, as he has done in Eleagmss and Junci, and
when, falling in with this modern innovaffion, he invents a mul-
titude of new orders to embrace every known species of plant.
'l'he mammiferous animals are arranged with more ease ac—
cording to a natural system, in consequence of their number
being comparatively small⁷ and their forms strongly marked.
Nevertheless the system of M. Cuvier, in the “ Regae Animal‚''
clearly shows the vain attempt of finding a place for every thing.
Nothing can be more satisfactory and beautiful than many of his
orders and divisions 3 yet see how he is compelled to change his
ground when he comes to the Paclzyclermata, and to huddle to-
gether species very remotely connected. His birds also exem-
plit'y the same fact, where his order Passeres is made to include
all that his other orders will not hold. ‘⁶ Son caractere semble
d’abord purement negatif, car il embrasse tous les oiseaux qui
ne sont ni nageurs, ni eclmssiers, ni grimpeurs, ni rapaces, ni
gallinaces.'‘’ Thus it contains the Warblers, the Shrilx‘es, the
Goatmckers, the Crows, the Creepers; birds of the most dis—
similar habits, and living upon the most dissimilar food. The
Chough is separated widely from the Corvi, and Anthus from
i-llcmcla. Now this is what we might expect from the nature os
the subject; only it is desirable that the remainder of unknown
things should be distinctly avowed, and not reduced to an exact

place in the natural system. Jussieu's was the most philosophie
mode,
