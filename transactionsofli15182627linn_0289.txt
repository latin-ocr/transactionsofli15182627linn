11011 1110 point more particularly, as the colour of the bill appears
to 115, judging at least from the specirnens before us, to offer a
strong mark of distinction between this bird and the next, the

The speciinens in our museum were not among the birds
originally collected by Mr. Caley. In that gentleman’s Notes,
however, we find the following observations‚ which we make no
doubt apply to this species. “ 'l'he natives tell me of another
kind of Coc-Amoo (besides Hyla and Get-ingero), which they call
Carat'. It is very shy. It scrapes dirt out of the hollow boughs,
and makes its nest 115 the others do. It lays two eggs, the colours
of which I did not ascertain. 'l'he nest is found by 111110111110ι the
bird into the hole. It. does not make Co'tora, nor cut off the
branches of the trees : but it cuts off May’rybor'ro and sslmz'mow
(the fruit of two species of Persoonia), without however eating
1110111, before they are ripe, to the great injury and vexation of
the natives.'' M1·.Caley 11115 inforlned 115, that he recollects
having shot a bird soon after his arrival in the colony, which he
believes to have been of the 5111110 species as the Cal. Coolciz' of
the Society's collection. It difl'ered from the Hyla and Ger-in-
gara in having no yellow in its plumage. He also expresses his
opinion that Cal. Coolsii 15 1110 Carat' of the nativos.
