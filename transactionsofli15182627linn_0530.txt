478 Dr. HAnwooD on tlte Hands qf an Orcmg Otang.

From the evidence which has been thus briefly adduced, 1
shall in concluding only further observe, that I consider the
differences mentioned fully sufficient to disprove the identity
of the Simia Satyrus with the Pongm though they are at the
same time very closely ullied to each other. The specimens of
the hands which l have taken the liberty of bringing under your
notice, may most probably have belonged to the former animal,
in which case they afford ει very imposing example of his vast
physical powers, when allowed to attain mature age in the
shady recesses of his native forests.
