shown a figure of a coloured plant5 used to put its tongue to the
flowers, as if with the intent of sticking them: and l have seen
it make the same attempt with a piece of cotton furniture. The
flesh of this bird is very good eatingf

Although‚ according to general custom, we have referred our
New Holland birds of this species to the P.sitt.l1<emat0dus of
Linnaeus, we have strong doubts as to their being the same ¹spe-
cies. lt is not, however, in our power at present to make any
decisivo observations on this point, as we have not been able to
procure a sufficient number of authentic specimens of the Mo-
lucca birds, from whence Linnaeus's original description was
taken, to compare with our Australian specimens. We have also
to add, that a bird agreeing with the above description of the
female of this species, which we have marked with a note of
doubt, was brought from New IIolland, and presented to the
Society as the female of the Blae Mometain Par-rot. This bird
accurately aecords with M. Le Vaillant’s figure os the female of
the Pcrruche ὰ tcto bleffe. ΨΘ are of opinion, however, that
it will prove to belong to a very distinct species. Mr. Caley,
whose observations on the spot were most accurate, informs us
that he noticed little difference in plumage between the sexes
of the Blae illozmtain Parrot. And among hundreds of skins of
this species, which have come under our own observation‚ we
have never seen a. second specimen agreeing with the bird to
which we allude. It is not probable that one sex should be so
common in the collections sent home to this country, and the
other sex. equally attractive in phunage, be so extremely rare.
