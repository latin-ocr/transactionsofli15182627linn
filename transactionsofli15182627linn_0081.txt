which at first puzzled me not a little as to its natural affinitieS.
On dissecting it, however, and comparing it with the genus Sa-
gra on one side, and on the other with a New Holland insect
allied to Bmzclms, which, from the circumstance of its being
found on plants of the genus Banlcsia, I have called Carpoplzagus
Banlssice, Ι ascertained in some degree its natural place. But the
Illegamerus was pentamerous ; while Sagra, leading off to the
Linnean genera Cerambya* and Chrysomela, and while Bruclms,
leading off to C zzz-calio, were both recorded as tetramerous. It
was, however, observable that the tarsus of my pentamerous
insect differed in no other respect from that of Sagra and
Brut-llus ‚· that is, from the tarsus of the majority of M. Latreille's
Section of Tem-amera. The three first joints of its tarsus were in
short dilated into species of cushions, of which the last was bi-
lobed, while the fourth joint was short, slender, obconical, and
forming at first sight one piece with the fifth ; so that the three
first articulations formed a dilated part of the tarsus, and the two
last 3 filiform part. Had it not been for the presence of the
fourth joint and its remarkable size in the Ilffegamerus Kingii, I
might indeed have described its tarsus in the very words which
in the Regnc Animal are applied to this partos the foot in the
Linnean groups Curculio, CerambyQ and Clzrysomela .· “ Le des-
sous des trois premiers articles des tarses est spongieux ou garni
des brosses avec le penultieme divise profondement en deux
lobes.” But on examining carefully Sagra and Carpoplzagus,
these genera will be found pentamerous in the same manner as
IlIegamerus. May it not then be possible, we naturally ask, that
the majority of insects hitherto called tetramerous, are in reality
pentamerous insects? An accurate examination of any Lin-
nean Cerambyir, Οιινειιίἱο, or Clu-ysomela will prove it to be so,

and that, in fact, the accurate description of the tarsus in these
three
