XVIII. A Review qf tlte Genus Combretmn. By Ilsr. George
Doti, A.L.S.

Reacl sslarclz 21, 1826.

THE rapid increase of new species has rendered monographs
absolutely necessary, as the only sure means of determining the
peculial* characters of each. Perhaps no genus affords a more
striking example of this rapid increase than the genus Com-
bretzcnz. The latest general work, nanrely, Sprengel's Systema
lfegetabilizmz, contains only six, while in 1110 following mono-
graph 1110 number amounts to forty-one.‚ exclusive of four doubt-
ful ones, recorded in the Hortus Bcngalensis, some of which are
most probably identical with some. of those 11010 described.

As few plants surpass Combreta in 1110 brilliancy and elegance
of their 11105501115, 50 111011 51100105 have become great fuvourites
With collectors. The Combrelzcm purpurewn has long been one
of the greatest ornaments of our stoves ; but some of 1110 51100105
lately introduced are likely to outvie it in beauty. The species
of the gemm, and indeed of the whole order, with 1110 0500111100,
perhaps, of Combrctzmz mmmm from Nepal, are exclusively con—
fined to tropical countries ; 11111 the largest 111-0110111011 15 peculiar

In order to facilitate a knowledge of the 51100105, Ι have
divided the genus into ‹livisions and sections, which will be
found separately characterized 111 111011 respective places.
