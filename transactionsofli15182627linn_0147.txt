but as it has smooth leaves, it can be neither one nor the other.
The proper synonyma of the Feralia, which Connneline referred
to the Karou Alou, Plukenet (dlm. 144.) refers to his Ficus In-
dica Tiliae solio, subtus albo et villoso, polyrleiizos, sen ‘silmnentc's e
summis ramis acl lert-am missis radicosa, which he procured from
the sea-shore of Barbadoes, and of which a figure is given
(t. 178.f. 3.); and with this also he coufounds the Pipal of the
Bengalese, although in f. 2. he gives a representation of this
plant which cannot be mis-taken. The plant of Barbadoes by
M. Lamarck (Eue. JlJetlz. iii. 35¹3.) is referred to the Hibiscus
tiliaceus, not without strong grounds: yet it is diffie-ult to sup-
pose such an error in Plukenet, especially as he no doubt
represents the Hibis-cns tiliaceus in another place (Amaltle. vi.
t. 355. f. 5.). Ι ani therefore inclined to follow W'illdenow in
thinking the plant of Barbadoes to be at least a Ficus (Sp. Pl.
iv. 11:313), although Ι doubt much of its being the &sconem-us of
Egypt, as he supposes. The figure no doubt resembles a good
deal that of the Sycomorus Matlze'oli in John Bauhin (llist. Plant.
i. 1⁶24. f. 1.) ;—but who ever heard of the Sycainore growing in
Barbadoes as a lNlangrove '? This opinion originated probably
with Burman (Fl. Ῑηιί. 2⁶25.); and Ι doubt as much of the fact
of the *S'yccmzorus being found in the East, as in the W'est, Indies.
The plant that Burman mistook for it is probably what I take to be
the Ficus Caricoicles of Dr. Roxburgh (Ilm-t. Beng. δᾶ), of which
l have deposited specimens in the library at the India IIouse.
Having thus endeavoured to correct the error into which l
fell when treating of the Peralu and Ficus Indica, and to show
that neither it nor the Kalon Aloe( was known to Plukenet, I
return to Burman, who, following the first edition of the Species
Plantarum, gives us (Fl. [ml. 225.) the Katozc Alon as the true
Ficus [mlh-a of the ancients, but without quoting any American

plant as synonymous. He however adds as a variety the Tsjela,
