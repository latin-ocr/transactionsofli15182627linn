90 Dr. Famem HAMrLTON’s Commentary

AonA MARAM, p. 23. tal). 50. 31.

In the Commentary on the lIerharium Amboinense (i. 136),
when treating of the Ariona, Ι have said all that occurs to me
as necessary concerning this plant. From a slight resemblance
in the fruit, this and the preceding tree have been erroneously
classed by the Brahmans of Malabar with the Α rtocarpus in the
genus Ponossozc.

ANanm, p. 25. tab. 32.
In the Connnentary above mentioned (i. 109), when treating

This is the plant which Ι mentioned in the Connnentary on
page 17 as having been considered by the natives as belonging
to the same genus with the Artocarpzcs integr-{folism no doubt a
very rude arrangement, as Commeline in his subjoined note
remarks.

Plukenet formed a much more accurate conjecture (Alm. 47.
δε 203.) 111 classing it with his Arbor Amerzcmza triplzylla, fructu
Platani quodamnodo oeoenulanz‘e (Plzgst. t. 77. f. 4.); which in
another place (ΑΖΗ). 356.) he calls Scabiosa dendroides Ameri-
cana, ternis foliis circa caulem ambientibus, floribus oclzrolcucis,
which is the Ceplzalantlzus occidentalis. Linnaeus accordingly in
the Flora Zeylanica, 53, called this plant the Cephalantlms soliis
oppositis. Ile afterwards, however, considered that its having
five stamina was a ground sufficient for separating it from the
CeplzalanthuS, which has only four; and therefore in the first
edition of the Species Plantarum he called it Naue-lea orientalis, in
