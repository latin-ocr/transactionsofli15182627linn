a sixth section added to these, called Illonomera, the insects 01
which are said to have only one joint to the tarsus.

It is unfortunate for this system, that if it be considered as
an artificial one, in which all coleopterous insects are to find a
place, very little examination is sufficient to prove that multitudes
of Coleoptcra exist which are neither pentamerous nor 11101101110-
