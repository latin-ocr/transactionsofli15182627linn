and short; the candal scuta truncate, in 60111361 with the
upper shell‚ excepting 3 slight emargination for the passage
of the tail3 the spaces for the hinder legs very small and
contracted.

As I have only seen the 511611 of this species, I am unfortu-⁵
nately obliged to confine the description to that part.

I have in my collection two specimens of this Tortoise, which
differ considerably from each other both in colour and form.
In 0116, 1116 ground-colom· of the upper shell is deep blaek‚ the
radiations of a bright clear yellow‚ and the sternum of 3 113111
yellow: the areae of the (101531 561113 316 quite fiat, and the
hinder partos the back somewhat depressed. In the other, the
ground-colom· is of a deep blaekish-brown‚ the radiations very
obscure, and the sternum of a brownish-yellow 6010111, 1116 31116-

of dissimilarity however, which give at first sight 3 strikingly

to identify them 35 111(11ν1(111315 of the same Species.
