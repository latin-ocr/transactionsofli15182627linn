1¹32 Dr. FRANCIS IIAMILTON'S Commentary

This species is distinguished by the narrowness of its leaflets‚
each being= froni [Σὲ to 3 times longer than its breadth, by
the long form of its berries, and by its numerous stamina.
Rheede further says, ‘⁴ Fructus intus carne humida quadripar-
tita;'' which perhaps implies four placentie, although in my
notes l have not remarked this part of the structure.

On the banks of rivers in the Gorakhpur district I found a
similar tree in fiower; but its lcaflcts were rather shorter in pro-
portion to their brcadth, its tlower was not odorous‚ and its
stamina fewer: so that, although the natives said it had an
oblong fruit, and although they called it Γανιιηα, Ι have doubts
of its being the Mirvala. It was however a male tree, with only
a few hermaphrodite fiowers intermixed‚ while the Νἱνυαία of
Rheede is an hermaphrodite ; which may occasion a difference.
I shall in the mean time, therefore, consider this as merely a
variety of the Cratoevcc Niirvala.
