111 the sea, attached to sheHS, corallineS, and marine plants.

Root, a very minute callous disk, giving rise immediately to
several very delicate fronds, which are from 2 to 4 inches in
length, and regularly divided many times in a dichotomous
manner, the segments divaricated, linear, 1——3 lines 111
breadth, obtuse at the apex, the margin entire. The reti—
czzlatz'on is very irregular, similar to that of D. punctam„
Colozcr a most delicate and beautiful pink, acquiring a
brownish tinge towards the base; but in decay becoming·
almost colourless. Ι have not observed any capsular fruc-
tification, but the sori (as Agardh calls the clusters of seem-
ingly naked granules) are scattered without any particular
order over the frond.

lt is now two years since I received excellent specimens of this
highly beautiful plant, collected in Devonshire by my esteemed
friend Mrs. Griffiths : as few persons are so well acquainted with
the actual vegetation of marine Algce, her opinion in favour of
its being an undescribed species must be allowed to have great
weight. Besides however studying the preserved specimens, Ι
had an opportunity of examining some in their native place of
growth at Torquay a few weeks ago, and thus am enabled to add

my opinion to hers 111 support of their distinctness.
