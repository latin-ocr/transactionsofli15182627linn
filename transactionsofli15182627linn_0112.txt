100 Dr. FRANCIS HAMILTON'S Commentary

joined it would however seem to be the same with folium ob-
tusam eam (telumue,- but in looking at Rheede's figure there is
no such appearance, and the leaves of the Spalim, as figured in
the Hortus illalabaricas, are more clearly marked as elliptica,
than those of the. szgimn, which are nearly lanceolata. On the
whole, after comparing the descriptions of Rheede and Rum-
phius with a plant very common in India, I can see no essential
difl'erenee, and therefore adhere to the opinion of Linnaeus, in
considering the Syalita and Songimn as one plant. Willdenow
however (Sp. Pl. ii. 1251, 1259.) and M. Poiret (Eae. Meth.
vii. 150, 151.) adopt the opinion of Thunberg, but entirely on
his authority, neither of them having seen the plant.

Ι shall here take an opportunity of describing three Indian
Dillenias, although each may have been already described; for
it is of advantage to have accounts from different persons, and
I have deposited speciinens in the library at the India IIouse.
