* Several species of the New Holland birds 111 the Society's collection were de-
÷‹·1ii›ed by Dr. Lathani in his “ General [lister-y,’' but did not at the sanie time receive
their scientific names, which were intended to appear in a second edition of the ‘⁴ Indez
()›11ithologicns.'' Being unwilling in our present undertaking to anticipate the harnes
of the first describer of these birds, we applied to Dr. Lathani for permission to use hi>
manuscript naines7 which he kindly granted. In the case of the species before 115, he
expressed 1115 wish to dedicate 11 to Lord Stanley‚ who had presented him with 1116 spe-
cimen from which he drew 1115 original description: and we feel much pleasure in unitinu
with him in paying this well-inerited coinpliinent.
