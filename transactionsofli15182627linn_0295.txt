The chief difference between the typical species of this genus
and those of the preceding, lies in the roundness and compara-
tive shortness of the wing, and the elevation of the tarsi of the
former. Other more minute distinctions may be also detected
sufficient to separate the groups; such ais the more rounded
culmen of the bill of Platycerczcs, the breadth and depression of
the tail : the abrupt emargination of the webs of the quill-
feathers, &o ; but the former characters of the wings and tarsi
are the most decisive, as indicating the greater developement.
of the characters of these neighbouring groups. These charac-
ters at once point out. the terrestrial habits of Platgsccrcus. And
they not only show that the food of the birds of that genus is
found upon the ground, but they evince their superior activity
and greater freedom of action, when compared with the remain—
ing groups of the family, whose gait is awkward and embar-
rassed, and who seem to possess no powers of motion on the
ground. The species enumerated in this genus accord in gene-
ral with the above characters taken from Pl. Pennantii, which
may be considered the type ; with the exception of Pl. scapula-
tus, or Ix'ing's Parrot, which exhibits some slight deviation from
the characters of the bill. This difference, however, is not of

sufficient
