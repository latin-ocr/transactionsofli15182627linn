5. S. Olus (Long—eared Owl).

A pair of Long-eared Owls bred a few years since in Staven-
der-park near Orsord. 'l'here were live young ones in the nest,
one of which was kept alive for four years. It is said to be

being disturbed they would take their ssight high in the air,
where they resembled Hawks.

Ravens issued successively, and were instantly attacked and
driven off with the greatest irnpetuosity by a Crow, which had
been seated on the same 1100 with thern. The antipathy, indeed,
these birds bear to each other is very strong, as we have more
than once had an opportunity of noticing. During the breeding·
season we have seen a, single 1ἶοοκ attack and drive away a
Raven which had approached its nest, the Rook uttering at the
sanie 111110 a very angry note. Yet the Raven, when iinpelled by
the force of affection for its young, may be superior to the Book,
as appears by the instance recorded by Mr. Markwick, of a pair
of Ravens, which had a nest at Broomham in Sussex, causing
