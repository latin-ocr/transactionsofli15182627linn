148 Dr. Famem HAmeroN's Commentary

which he places immediately after the Ficus religiosa, a species
that does not. send these tibres from its branches. 11 seems,
however, to 116 011 1116 11151 supposition of Plukenet alone that
Linnaeus and the younger Burman (Fl. I11cl.<2‘2(›'.) joined the
Tsjcla to the Ficus indica, placing it in the same variety with the
[bringa latg'f'olia of Ruinphius (Herb. Amb. iii. 1127. t. 84), which
cannot possibly be admitted (see my Commentary, Linn. Trans.
xiii. 487). [1 seems indeed difficult to suppose how Burman
could imagine the Tfil't'lsl, with leaves nearly lanceolam, to belong
to the same species with the Kalon Mon, which has ovate or
cordate leaves. I indeed think it probable that this quotation
arose from an error in the person who engraved the (14111 plate
in this volume of the Hortus lllalaharicns, and who instead of
Tffjalcela has placed over it T.fjc¹l(e,· so that Burman seeing this,
considered it as the plate representing the 'l'ffjeloe

I have already mentioned, when treating of the Katou Alou,
that M. Lamarck selected it for his Ficus Indica: but rejected
the ngclcn as not sending roots from its branches; and neither
he nor M. Poiret attempted to introduce it into the system.
WVilldenow, on the contrary, rejecting the Kalon Αἶσα, adopts
the 7'.3·jel‹1 for his Ficus Indica, leaving out from his specitic cha-
racter the essential words ramis radimutibw, used by Linnaeus.
Willdenow had seen specimens of his Ficus Indica3 but whether
they belonged to the Tfjcla or to the faringa latejblia it is impos-
sible to say, as he quotes both. Dr. Roxburgh, who most pro—
perly restored the name Ficus Indica to the Peralu, or Banyan-
tree, and who was perfectly acquainted with the Tffjcla, calls it
Fisus 'I'sjae’la (Hm-t. Beng. 66).

Resides the 'J'fjelffi I have found in Gangetic India three other
species so very nearly allied, that the names Nalm, Palm, and
Nalcsa are applied to them in a different manner by different

persons.
