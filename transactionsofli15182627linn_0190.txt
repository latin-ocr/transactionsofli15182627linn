life and the labours of man did not permit himself to enter it.
But he lived sufficiently long to conduct the followers of nature
to the Pisgah of science, and to show them, in his prophetie
admonitions, the abundance of the territory which lay within
their reach, and the paths through which they might hope to
occupy that land of promise. Itis not, we conceive, too pre-
suinptuous to affirm& that he would himself have followed the
same paths which we are now all pursuing in conformity with his
instructions, had 116 lived to accompany and regulate our move-
ments.

XVere there to exist, however, a case in which it would be
allowable for a disciple of Linuaeus to depart not only from his
mode of nomenclature, but even from his general principles, that
case is now before us. The subjects which we have attempted
to arrange come srom a country scarcely more than the name of
which was known in the days of Linnaeus. And it is to be
recollected, that in the variety and novelty of the forms of its
animal productions, that country presents an almost totally in-
sulated character. Among the number of birds which are now
in the Society’s museum, and which are daily increasing our
Australian collections, not much above ten, certainly not twenty,
species could have come under the inspection of Linnaeus; and
these are species merely which are common to the islands of the
