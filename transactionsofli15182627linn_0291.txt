XVe have already observed, that no species of the subfamily
slsum-ocercina, or the Mat-cares, the next succeeding group to the
subdivision of Cocli-awos which we have just quitted‚ has been
found in Australia. Neither has the recently-described genus
Psitlacara, V., or the Perrucltc-Aras of M. Le Vaillant, which
connects the Macran-*s with the present subfainily of falcem—nina,
been met with in that country. Neu· lIolland, however, supplies
the next link in the chain 0fafli11itics; and in 3 singularly beau-
tiful assemblage of birds, diminutive in their size, but brilliant
and attractive in their plumage, affords the representatives of the
New world „lllacrocercua These birds, or the genus Namades,
the characters of which we have given above, have ‘the bill and
general form of lllacrocercns; and, with the exception of the
naked cheeks, appear perfect sslaccazes in ininiature. The first
species enumerated, N. discolor, may be considered the type of
the group. The two last species will be found partially to
deviate from this type, as we shall observe in its place, and to
form the passage to the succeeding genus?

* The above ,ξι-0111) is as nearly allied to Pezoporns as to Platysercus; and it might
perhaps, in a rude distribution of species, be included in that genus from a conformity
in general appearance and habits. We are induced to keep it separate, in consequence
of its close affinity to the sslaccazrs, and for the purpose of more strongly marking out,
by such a generic separation, one of the intervening gradations by which the species of
this extensive family are beautifully connected with each other. Namades with Platy-
cet-cus and Pezoporus form a natural group, the species of which return into themselves
in a 611611131- 5366655101]-ἲ 311(1 they thus constitute a minor subdivision of the present
subsannly. We take this opportunity of pointing out the other subdivisions with which
it is connected. The subfarnily of Palam-nina comprises, first, the I'arralst’ct Mac-
caws of South America, or the genus Psittacam, V.; secondly, the present Australian
group of Ground Part-almas, including Nanodes, Plutycerczts, and Pezoporus, and con-
nected with the preceding Parrulceet Illaccazc‘s by Nanodes discolor,· thirdly, the Indian
group of Palam-nis, which is united with the Ground Parralceecs by means of the New
Holland species Pal. BarrabancIi3 fourthly, the Part-alceets whose tongue is fila-
mentous, such as the Australian and Indian genera Trichoglossus and Lurius, which
