The species of this family found in Australia are numerous,
and they exhibit a considerable variety of fornr These, with
the exception of one or two groups which are equally met with
in some of the adjoining islands in the Pacific Ocean, are pecu-
liar to their own continent. They belong to two only of the five
subfamilies of the Psittacizlae; those of the Coclcatoos and the
long-tailecl I'arralceet.s·. Hitherto we have seen no example from
Australia of the true Psittacus, Auct, of the conterminous sub--
family of even-tailecl Pazvvlceets, or of the sslaccczws.

Although from the general resemblance which the birds of
this family bear to each other, it may at first sight appear dif-
ficult to determine which are the typical and aberrant groups, it
strikes us that we may attain a clue to this point of distinction
by attending to the construction of the bill, and tracing out the
mode in which it varies from the strength and shortness appa-
rent in some species, to the weakness and elongation exhibited
in others. The food os the Parrols consists chiefly of nuts,
seeds, and similar vegetable substances; and the bill, which
possesses the greatest power in breaking the hard shells or
rinds which inclose these substances, seems to point out the
typical pre-eminence of the groups in which it is found. This
strength of bill may be observed to be carried to the ex-
treme in the two subfamilies of Coclcutoos and Μαθθαῖος. In
these birds the mandibles are of considerable size and thick-
ness, and much inore deep than long z more especially the under
mandible, which is extremely short, and bent inwards at the
apem so as to give the bill a <greater power over the substances
