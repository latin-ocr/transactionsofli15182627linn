Mr. Caley met with these birds but sparingly‚ and after the
interval of some years. He conjectured that the period of their
migration into the colony was not regular, or that few arrived.
The species was first discovered in New Zealand, whence they
probably migrate into the adjoining continent.

The chief difference between this bird and the preceding
species lies in the colours of the upper parts inclining more to
a metallic red than to green, in the head and adjacent parts
being inore saturated, and the fascic& on the abdomen being less
brilliant; while the marks of the tail-feathers also are distinct.
In C. lucidus the outer feathers have four white spots on each
barb, while in the present species they have five white spots
marked with ferruginous. The other tail-feathers of the {latter
bird are also alternately fasciated with fuscous and ferruginous,
while those of C. lucidus are free from spots, except a single

fuscous
