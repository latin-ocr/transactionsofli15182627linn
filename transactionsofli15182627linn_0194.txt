inclined to assign it a place among the proverbially slothful and
cowardly l'zclturidce. The nearest approach to the characters of
that family that has come under our observation among the
birds of Australi-a is in the genus Polyborus of M. Vieillot, the par-
tially naked cheeks of which are allied to those of the Vultures.
That gemm, however‚ possesses so many characters in common
with the Fulconidoe, particularly with the Fislzing Eagles‚ that it is
generally ranked in that family, but at that extremity of it which
meets the family now before us. This genus Polyboras is said
to assume much of the manners of the T'ultzzres, and may per—
haps be considered as in some degree to supply their place
in Australia. But on this and similar points we do not at
present wish to hazard an opinion. Coniecture may be allowed
in some measure to supply the place of facts, when facts are
incapable of being ascertained: but with 50 early a prospect
of having· our doubts cleared up upon every subject relating
10 1116 zoology of New IIolland, it is perhaps more prudent
merely to express them.

Fam. ΡΑ 1001171111.

In this family there are many species and many forms in the
Australian Fauna. The forms, however, are such as are com-
mon to every other part of the world, with the exception of the
genus Polyborus‚ to which we have just alluded‚ and which is
confined 10 southern latitudess although widely distributed as to
its longitudinal extent. We may generally observe with respect
to the groups of the Pale-onim, that they know no bounds as to
their geographical distribution. Preying indiscriminately upon
all species of the inferior 111111111115, and not being contined, like
many other tribes of birds, to a particular or a local food, the
different forms that compose the family may readily be con-
ceived to be dispersed all over the 810116. Their powers of
