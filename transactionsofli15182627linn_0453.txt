a conclusion is more natural and just, than to suppose these
conflicting descriptions true, and that the poets and common
observers were false witnesses.

I now proceed to give what virgil says respecting the name

which no sweat-sucking¹ Tahanus, Comps, or modern Asilas„

poet uses the word 111 another place, where the allusion is too
distinct to be mistaken :
