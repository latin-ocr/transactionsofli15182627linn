judged to be his Folium politorium (Ilerb. Amh. iv. 128. t. 63..)
These Burman also considered (fl. [ml. (2¹26.) as the same spe-
cies, which from the Javanese name he called Ficus Ampelos.
M. Lamarck, treating of the F. Ampelos (Eme. ΑΠςιΙΙι. 11. 4901),
quotes Rumphius with doubt ; on what grounds he does not say,
but his plant has the mouth os the ret-cptaculmn so open as to
render it an intermediate link between ficus and Αιηὸονιις from
which we may safely conclude that it is neither the Folium poli-
toy-inm nor Teregam. On this account probably &Villdenow has
altogether omitted the [ficas Ampelum and on the authority of
Loureiro has referred the Folium politorum! to a species which
he calls Ficus politoris( (Sl). Pl. iv. 1144), a name which he
should not have used, because M. Lamarck had previously given
it to a very different species (Eae. flletle. ii. 5()().). Resides, as
Loureiro describes the fruit to be disposed in spikes, he probably
meant a plant different from that of Rumphius and Rheede,
although it may have leaves fitted to polish wood ;—-for such a
quality is found in several species of this genus, and 15 there-
fore no proof of identity. In this opinion I am confirmed by
Dr. Roxburgh, who neglects Loureiro's quotation, and calls the
Foliumpolitorium, Ficus erasperata (Ilm-t. Beng (302), thinking it
different from the Ficus Ampelos of Koenig (Hert. Reng. 103).
Whatever may be the 01150 with these modern innovations, 1
have little or no doubt of the Tercgam and Folium politorium
being the same plant, andos their being the Ficus Ampelos of
Burman.

The name Cara-valli, applied to this tree by the Brahmans of
Malabar, contains both a spccitic and generic appellation. Cara,
the specific name, signifies “wild ;’' and l'attc' is a corruption of
Vota, the Sanscrita name of the Ficus indica, a word perhaps
derived from the same root with the Vates of the Latin, as
under the shade of this tree the Gymnosophists of old delivered
