when 1110 evaporating force is unusually great, or the electricity
of the atmosphere is remarkable for its intensity ¹⁴²².

But though each of the alleged causes just adverted to appears
incompetent to produce the required effect, yet one abundantly
adequate may perhaps be found in the physical endowments
ot' the animals themselves, or in the extreme lightness of their
webs z these two last-named suppositions therefore merit 0 0010-
1111 examination.

lf the spiders do inipel their lines upward by the voluntary
exercise of some animal function which has hitherto eluded the
10500101105 of physiologists, it follows, that when the communi-
cation is interrupted, 1110. 111105, unless influenced by some other
force, must necessarily fall. Now the reverse of this uniformly
ensues : for if the insects, after having commenced their ascent,
010 suddenly separated from the lines to which they are attached,
the latter still continue to ascend, their motion being accelerated
by their diminished gravity, but the former are rapidly pre-
cipitated to the ground. The conclusion is obvious. The buoy-
ancy of the lines cannot be occasioned by the beings which pro-
duce them ; and the 0500111 of large flakes of web unoccupied by
spiders, before alluded to, confirrns this opinion.

Perhaps the buoyancy os lines from which spiders have been
detached, and of webs altogether destitute of these 11150015, may
be regarded as facts powerfully contributing to establish the
idea that this animal secretion is specifically lighter than the
mixed gases which compose the atmosphere. The fallacy of
this notion, however, is easily proved by experiment. In the
