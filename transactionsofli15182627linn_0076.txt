characteristic, we may daily perceive that accurate observation
remains still a desideratum, merer because we are too apt to
despise minutiae, and too ready to adopt the recorded obscr-
rations· ot' others as truc, for no other reason than because they
arc so recorded. A curious instance of this facility in trusting
to the observations of others Ι shall proceed to explain: not
merely because it has led myself as well as all other modern ento-
mologists into very inaccurate descriptions‚ but because a. system

(fiieoffroy appears to have been the first to observe that the

to have been the first to make use of this variation 111 forming· a
system ofarrangement for the order? ln alluding to this system
of Geoffroy, M. Latreille says, “ L'ouvrage de ce celebre natu-
raliste est peut—&tre celui qui a le plus contribuc aux progrcs de

M. Latreille and the other French naturalists fancied that they
had found a key to a natural arrangement, the honour of which
would indisputably belong to France. In the Genera [insectorum
