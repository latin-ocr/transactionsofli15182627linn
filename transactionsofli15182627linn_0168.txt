ΤΠ n following description and figure (TAB. I.) of the Lapland
Bunting (the bring-illa lapponica of Linnaeus, the Emberiza cal-
cat-atu of Tennninck), is taken from a specimen in the valuable
cabinet of my friend N. A. Vigors, Esq. This individual, which
from its plumage appears to be a young bird, was fonnd in
Leadenhall-nlarket among some Larks, which had been sent up
to London from Cambridgeshire, and was preserved by a respec-
table naturalistss, from whose collection it afterwards passed
into that of Mr. Vigor& As a species hitherto unnoticed in
Britain, Ι have great pleasure in adding it to the list of our
Fauna, which within the last few years has become enriched by
several new and rare specieS.

lector hare already been recorded in these Trans-actious. See vol. xiv, p. 561.

A second individual of this species, taken alive in the neighbourhood of Brighton,
and kept caged sor some months, as a variety of Lark‚ is now in the possession of
Μῑ. Yarrell of Ryder-strcet. It differs from the specimen described in being gene-
rally of a dart-er colour, the spots upon the brcast and neck arc also inore distinct,

age or sex, or it may be the result of confinemcnt. To the last—mentioned cause may
