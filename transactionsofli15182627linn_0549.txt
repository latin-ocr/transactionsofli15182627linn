Dmn SIR,

UNDERSTA NDING upon my return from North-west America,
that considerable interest has been excited by reports of a new
species of Pinus of gigantic size having been discovered by me
in Northern California, I beg perlnission through you to lay a
short account of it before the Linnean Society.

This plant covers large districts about a hundred miles fron]
the ocean, in latitude 430 North, and extends as farto the South
as 400. It first came under my notice in August 1825, while at
the headwaters of the BIultnomah River. In October 1826 it
was my good fortune to meet with it beyond a range of moun-
tains running ina south-western direction from the Rocky Moun-
tains towards the sea, and terminating at Cape Orford of Van-
couver. It grows sparingly upon low hills, and the undulating
country east of the range of mountains just mentioned, where
the soil consists entirely of pure sand⁷ in appearance incapable
of supporting vegetation. Here it attains its greatest size, and
perfects its fruit in most abundance.

The trees do not form dense forests as most of the other
