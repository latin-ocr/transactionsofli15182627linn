that of the more typical species of Emberiza. It possesses, how-
ever, the palatial protuberance or knob, a characteristic feature
of the latter group 2 and its bill is in all respects similar in con-
formation to that of the §now Bunting (Emberiza nivalis Auct.),
which by Dr. Latham is placed at the head of his genus Em-
bere'm. ssy M.'1‘ennninck it is arranged with the Buntings,
forming with Emberiza nivalis his second section of that genus,
under the denomination of ‘⁶ Brzzants ἑρσφ·οηηῖενε.”

Τ116 comprehensive and enlightened views adopted by our
most eminent naturalists of the present day, in the classification
and arrangement of zoological objects, and which, in the de—
partment of ornithological science, have been so ably developed
by Mr. Vigors, have induced me to separate this species and
Fringilla nivalis from the true BuntingS, and to assign them a
station in accordance with their natural affinities. 111 doing this,
I follow the example of two eminent continental ornithologists,
MM. Meyer and Vieillot, both of whom have already separated
these two species from Embcriz‘a, the one under the generic title
of Plectroplzcmes‚ the other under that of Passerina. The appro-
priate station then, of this genUS, I conceive to be intermediate
between Alauda and Embetiza, and forming as it were the me-
dium of connexion or passage from 0116 genus to the other. 111
Alauda it is met by that section of the genus which, in the
increasing thickness and form of the bill, shows a deviation
from the more typical species, and a nearer approach to the
thick-billed Fringilla‘clse; to this section Alauda valonam, and
hraclzgsdactyla belong. Its affinity to the Larks is also shown
in 1116 form of the feet and production of the hinder claw:
11115 111 Ρ. Lappom'ca is nearly straight, and longer than the toe,
resembling in every respect that of many of the true Larks.
The habits and manners of the two known species also bear a

much greater resemblance to those of the Larks than the 111111-
tinge
