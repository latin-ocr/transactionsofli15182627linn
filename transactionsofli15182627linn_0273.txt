original name of any species. The present case seems to be
one where we are called upon to risk such an alteration. Out
of numberless birds of this species which have come. under our
observation‚ we have seen none in which the colour of the head
was not the same as that of the bird before us, a grayish-brown.
The white-headed specimen which Dr. Latham figured, and
from which he derived the name of lencoceplzala‚ appears to be
not a typica] individual of the specieS, but an accidental‚ or, as
far as is hitherto known, an unique variety of it. Even still we
should adhere to an established name, however strictly inappli-
cable to an entire group, if the original describer had named the
species from an actual specimen. But in the present instance
we find that Dr. Latham's figure and description are taken from
a drawing. We shall not, however, deprive this beautiful bird
of its original name without assigning it a better. And in pro-
posing the present alteration, we hope the venerable Father of
Ornithology will pardon us for the liberty we have taken, and
accept this slight tribute of gratitude. for the valuable assistance
which his labours have afforded us in our ornithological studies.

Mr. Caley calls this species Recl Diamoncl Bircssssthe colonial
name; he met with it occasionally, but not in abundance. He
is not aware of its habits.
