ΤΗ κ’, discovery of new generic forms is always 11 siibjGet of great
importance in 11 natural system, as they tend to throw light on
the affinities of those groups already known to us, and conse-
quently to give us more enlarged views of the beauty and ad-
vantages of the natural classilication. What renders the pre-
sent genus still more interesting is its partaking of the. characters
of two veryv distinet natural orders. l'ossessiilg all the essential
marks of the Set-ophalm-im, it agrees also with Jacaramla, a
genus belonging to the Rignoniaceoe, in the form and (fovering
of its seeds. This new genus I propose to denominate Lopho-
spcrmum, n name eomponnded of λοφος a erest, and σπεξμα seed,
in allusion to the form of its seeds. lt consists at present of
only two species, both natives of Mexic‹›‚ where they were (lis-
covered by the Spanish botanists Sesse and Mocinno, in whose
herbarium the one is marked llosleria scandens, and the other
Seroplmlaria pltysalo(les‚—names, 110 doubt, vaguely given them
at the time of collecting by the dise(›v‹··rers‚ os whose zeal and
knowledge ample testimony is nll'orded by the extensive collec—
tions which they made in that interesting· country. In a natural
series our genus must bc placed near to Mam-andiu and Λη-
tirrlcinnm. Its affinity to the former is shown by its calyx :md
