118 Dr. FnAs-ms HAMILTox's Commentary

35 1111111610115 35 111 any Capparis. The appearance of the Cra-
sse-ca is however so different from that of the Capparis, that they
cannot enter one natural ¹genus ; and Ι think the character
by which they may be best distinguished is, that the Capparis
has petulci sessilia, and the (mmm, petala nguiculata. Linnaeus
could not of course make use of this distinction, because the
petala of the Mar-melos are sessile. The fiowers of the Crataew
also are polygalnous‚ a large proportion being entirely male, with
only a rudiment of the pistillum. Whether or not they are all
dioecious I cannot say, but some are certainly so.

In the course of travelling. I observed that the specimens of
the Crataezm, which I examined‚ differed considerably from each
other, so as 10 163(1 1116 10 suspect that in India there may be
several species: but as I never afterwards was long enough
stationary in one place to observe the same tree in all its stages,
01· 10 try the effect of different situations on the seed of the same
plant, I ain by no means certain that my suspicions are well
founded. I shall however mention the circumstances by which
l was induced to suppose that there are at least four species of
Cratseva in the Gangetic provinces. This will at an)v rate throw
light 011 1116 11116 generic character. Specimens of the whole
have been deposited in 1116 library at the India House.

I shall first describe a species which I met with in Behar, and
which, I believe, is Dr. Roxburgh’s Capparis t7·{tbli‹1t(1‚ because
he does not quote the Nili-vala as synonymous⁷ and because he
thought it his plant when on my return from A va I showed him
specimens. lf it were not for the long point at the end of the
16311615, 111611 breadth would fully equal their length ; including:
these points, the breadth is about half the length.
