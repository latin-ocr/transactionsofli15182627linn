change their quarters, to a feeling· of insecurity occasioned by
their proximity to one another ;—the prodigious numbers which
in favourable seasons are usually congregated together affording
the more powerful individuals an opportunity, seldom neglected
by these voracious creatures, of making an easy prey of the
weaker: and this opinion is strengthened, if not confirmed, by
the fact, that they are chiefly animals which have not arrived at
maturity that undertake. these migrations.

I have asserted, that when the spiders which produce gossamer
perform their aerial journeys, they are borne upward by an
ascending current of raretied air acting on the slender lines
which proceed from their spinners. Ι shall now endeavour to
prove that this curious atmospherical phaenomenon, which well
deserves the attention of meteorologists, affords them the only
available means of accomplishing their object; and that the
hypotheses previously adverted to are quite irreconcileable with
facts, and consequently must be erroneouS.

It has been already stated, that gossamer is never seen fioating
in the air except in calm sunny weather 3 its buoyancy, therefore,
evidently does not depend upon the agency of winds, usually so
called z indeed it is probable that winds never do take an upward
direction, unless influenced by some extraordinary circumstance
or local peculiarity; the ascent of gossamer, on the contrary, 15
frequently observed to take place over a great extent of country
on the same day. It was noticed on the 151 of October, for
example, in England, lVales, and Ireland.

If a satisfactory explanation of this interesting fact cannot be
derived from the operation of winds, it is still less likely to he
deduced from the action of evaporation or electricity; for, not
to insist upon the probable, Ι 111111 almost said absolute, insuf-
ticiency of these powers considered as agentS, experiments show

that the spiders do not select those periods for making an ascent
