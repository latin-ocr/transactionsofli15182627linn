3. Τ. musicus (Song Thrush).
4. T. iliacus (Red-wing Thrush, Storm Bird).

5. Τ. torquatus (Ring-Ouzel).

The Ring-Ouzel has been met with in this part of the king-
dom at various seasons of the year; but it appears to be most
common in October, at. which time we have seen twenty of them

resembles that of the Fieldfare than that of the Black-bird.

6. T. Merula (Blackbird).

Genus XII. CINCLus.

1. C. aquaticas (VVater Ouzel).

dom.

was found among some high graSS‚ in a wood in the parish of
Stoke by Nayland, in which were six eggs. The old male bird
