plant under the name of Diospyros discolor. This is the Cava-
m'llea Mabolo of Lamarck (Ill. Gen. t. 454), and the Cavam'llea
Philippensis of M. Poiret (Eue. ssscllz. Sap. ii. 135: iii. 5602).
The latter seems to be of this opinion : yet, although the leaves
vary much in form, I have some doubt whether the Mabolo 15
1116 531116 species with the I'ane'tffjilccm because the former 11115
only four 01· six 566115, and is hairy; while the latter has eight
or ten, and 15 quite smooth. Concerning the genus there can
be no doubt. Brown (Nov. Holl. i. 595.) and Dr. Roxburgh
finally abandoned Embrgsopteris altogether, and called 11115 plant
Dios-pyros glutimfif'cra (Hert. Beng. 40.); while Persoon, con-
verting the generic into a specitic name, calls it Dyospyros Em-
hryopteris (Euo. Mem. Sup. iii. 566), which savours too much
of botanical Greek, and might 16311 0116 10 suppose that it was 3
Fern.

I have already mentioned that 1116 Maholo can scarcely be of
the same species with the Panitsjilsa, 011 account of its roughness
and the number of 566115 111 115 fruit. In the woods 5011111 of
the Ganges I found a 1166, which in the catalogue of specimens
presented to the library at the India IIouse (No. 9:389) I have
called Dios-pyros exsculpta, on account of its leaves being 35 11
were carved on the upper side. This, both in number of 566115
31111 pubescence resembles the Μαὸοίο, and may be the 531116,
although 115 leaves are much blunter than represented in M. La-
marck's figure. This, however, is uncertain: and 11 1111151 116
observed that I saw only the male fiowers, while the description
by M. Desrousseaux (Ena. Ilsetlz. iii. 664.) refers to the herma-
phrodite, which will account for some differenceS. Dr. Rox-
burgh, however, received a Mabolo from the Philippines, which
he considered different from the Dios-pyros tomentosa of Bengal :

and 11115 perhaps 15 1116 1166 I am going to describe, although the
