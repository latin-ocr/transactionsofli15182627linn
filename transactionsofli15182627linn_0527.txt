same diameter is 17 lines and a half, it is no less than 7 lines and a
half, or nearly equal to one-half 1116 hreadllz oftlze orbit. Neither
is the orbit itself in these 3111111315 placed on the same plane ; but
while almost vertical in the Satyrus, it forms in the Pongo an
angle with the horizon of many degrees less. These then appear
to be some of the most important distinctions. In their absence
indeed, the many others which exist in the form of the skull ot'
these 3111111315 might be attributable to age: for although those
os the Satyrus seen in Europe have the skull round and 53100111,
and the facial angle large (as is so well exelnplified 111 1116 skele—
tons at the Royal Institution, Mr. Brookes‘s, and at the College
of Surgeons), while in the Pongo the skull is angular, provided
with sharp ridges or 616515, and the facial angle much 53131161,
511611 (111-16163665, though less apparent, are seen between the
young and old of most other quadrupeds.

In addition to other arguments mentioned in favour of the
identity of the two 3111111315, 1116 French naturalists 355611 that the
vertebrae of each kind are the same 111 number. This conclu-
sion they seem to draw from the large skeleton of the Pongo
in the collection of Comparative Anatomy at Paris, but which,
being obviously imperfect in several of its parts, I 3111 much
inclined to consider is deficient in one of 115 lumbar vertebrae.
They then state all the proportions of the body and limbs to be
similar, each to be destitute of the hindei· thumb·nail; each to
have large cavities communicating 1111111116 larynx, and of the
same form; neither to possess 63110511165; and that the colour
differs only in being darker in the Pongo, as we see it in most
adult animals. We also know that they inhabit the same coun-
try. To these arguments Ι may with justice add, that the adult
Simia Satyrus, 35 distinct from the Pongo, has never been accu—
rately described: and that the Simia Satyrus seen here is evi-

dently the young of 3 large species, 35 15 determined by 1116
