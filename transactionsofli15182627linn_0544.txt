is destructive, as it appears to me, of his system as a means of
general reasoning.

ln 110 department of natural history are the inconveniences
arising out of this confusion of analysis and synthesis more felt
than in Entomology. The multitude of species included in this
kingdom of nature is so great, that it requires the most skilful
arrangement to enable the student to determine them: yet it
is unquestionably the worst furnished with assistance in 11115

the attempt which both we and our continental neighbours have

aimed at analysis and synthesis at the same time. A compre-

111 1116 large views taken by means of the natural system, our
business will for ever 116 1116 labour of separating what we shall
know from that which is unknown„ The profoundest knowledge
will at last be but a fragment. Some groups of nature are so
closely related, that they have been obserred from time imme-
morial. “ W hatsoever parteth the hoof and is cloven-footed,
and cheweth the cud,” comprehends a group of animals so 011-
viously connected, that they must have received a generic ap-
pellation from the remotest period. As knowledge has increased,
more and more families have been separated: still there is al-
ways a remainder of unknown things. 'l'ake any natural system,
and see if this is not the case. Linnaeus in his ‘⁴ Fragments of
a Natural Method'’ professes only to separate from the mass
those groups which he saw clearly. Again, his definition of
vegetables indicates the same truth : ‘⁶ Vegetabilia comprehen-
dunt Familias septem, szgos, Algas‚ Musam, Filioes, Gramina,
Palmas:²' and then, to include the remainder, he addS, “et
