82 Dr. FnANcis HAMILTON’S Commentary

Ι have only further to add, that in the figures the rIngs on the
stems are represented more regular and deep than I have ever
observed on the growing plant, which has probably prevented
Dr. Roxburgh (Hort. Beng. 71.) from quoting them.

KAToU INDEL, p. 15. tab. 22—25.

In India this is the most common Palm. The names Katw
hadel, Tamara (lo llluto, and Wild Damlel Boom iinply its being a
kind of Date; and the resemblance between it and the Date-
palm brought from Arabia is so great, that, except by the fruit, l
could not distinguish the one from the other: but I did not see
the flower of the Arabian plant. The fruits are very different in
quality, but not inore so than those of the Crab-apple and Pippin ;
yet the fiower of the Katozc Inde! differs so much from that of
the Plzoerziae (lactylifera, at least as this is described by Linnaeus‚
that he considered it as belonging to a different genus: for its
fiower has six stamina and three germina, while Linnaeus be-
lieved that the Date had three stamina and one germen ; and it
is still thus described in the Hortus Ix'ezrensis and by lVilldenow:
but M. Lamarck (Eue. Meth. ii. 961.) observes that the Plzoenilz·
dactylifera has six stamina. He indeed describes it as having
only one germen ; but he has perhaps been led to do this from
no more than one coming to maturity, as is the case also in the
Katou Inclel.

Neither Commeline in his note, nor Plukenet (Alm. 276),
seems to have been aware of the strong resemblance between
the proper Date-tree and the Katou Indel„ which they call Palma

sylvestris
