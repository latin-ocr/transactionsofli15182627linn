„Pines xvhich clothe the face of Plorssravestisslnerica, but lssze
Pinus resinosa, which grows among them, they are scattered
singly over the plains, and mayv be considered to form a sort of
connecting link between the glooniy forests of the north and
the more tropical-like verdure of California.

The trunk grows from 150 to above QUO feet in height, vary-
ing fron] ‘20 to near 60 feet in circumference. One specimen,
which had been blown down by the wind‚—and this was certainly
not the largest which I saw,—was of the following dimensions.
——Its entire length was <215 feet; its circulnference three feet
from the ground was 57 feet 9 inches ; and at 134 feet from the
ground, 17 feet 5 inehes. The trunk is unusually straight, and
destitute of branchos about two-thirds of the height; the bark is
uncsnnrnonly sniooth for such large tnnlnn½ of a hght-brouui
(xssour on the south, and.lfleaehed on the norssr fflde. 'The
branchos are rather pendulous, and {ernian} open pyranndal
head, with that appearance which is peculial· to the Abies tribe.
'she leaves are between 4 and 5 inches lvng, and grow in fives,
with a short sheath like those of Pinus &wolmffi they are rigid,
of a bright-grcen colour, but not glossy, and fron] minute den-
ticulations of the margin are scabrous to the touch. The eones
are pendulous from the extremities of the branches; they are
two years in acquiring their full growth, are at lirst upright, and
