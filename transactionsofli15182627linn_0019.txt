qf tlte Nor-folle and chffbllc Bircls. 7

15. F. cyaneus (Henharrier).

This bird breeds in the channel—fen at Barton in Norsolk,
where we have more than once thought ourselves in danger
of being attacked by it, when we had approached the place
where undoubtedly its nest was concealed.

Genus ΙΙ. STRix.
l. S. Nyctea. (Snowy Owl).

A female Snowy Owl was shot at Felbrigg in Norfolk the first
week in April 1814, the weight of which was 5} pounds ; length
2 feet; breadth 5 feet 4 inches. This is the first instance we
have heard of the Snowy Owl being seen in England. In the
month of January 1820 another specimen of the same bird was
killed near Gunton, not many miles distant from the spot where
the former one was found. The latter bird is now in the pos-
session of Lord Suffield.

22. S. Alaco (Brown Owl).
3. S.flammea (White Owl).

This bird, as well as others of the genus, is destructive among
rabbits‚ as we have been informed by a relative, who has shot it
in the very act of striking them on a warren ς and we have our-
selves frequently seen White Owls skimming over the burrows.

4. S. brachyotos (Short-eared Owl).

These Owls visit this part of the kingdom in September and
October, and remain till the spring. They arrive in flocks of from
ten to twenty, and frequent heaths ; in which respect they differ
from the Long-eared species, which is fond of the gloom of fir-
plantations. Montagu sayS‚ that the ears in a dead specimen

are not discoverable ; but in one which we have seen, the ears
remained
