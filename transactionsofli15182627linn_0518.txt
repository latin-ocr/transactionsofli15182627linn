466 Dr. SMiTli's Description oftwo Quadrupeds

a, great anxiety to carry things of every description to the place
where he was conlined: and whatever he got he invariably
showed much inclination to retain, as even the most trifiing
articles were not without difficulty regained. He always seeined
much delighted at the occurrence of rain, and during its con-
tinuance kept leaping and running about with unusual activity.
Great warmth appeared always to be disagreeable to him 2 and
whenever the 110111 of the sun was powerful, he regularly, if pos-
sible, got into the shade. On various occasions he appeared
playful and mild, which, however, there was reason to believe,
arose more froin cunning than from good-nature ; and on one of
these occasions he continued his faniiliarity till he got his play-
1111110, a young dog, within his grasp, after which he proceeded

cious, and as if in constant fear of snares; for 011 0110 or two
occasions I placed a connnon deal board obliquely across the
house in which he was contined, and it was not till a. consider-
able time after he had become accustonied to it that hc ventured
out of the distant corner into which at such times he regularly
retreated. On gaining sufficient confidence to enable him to
leave his retreat, he invariably advanced with much caution
towards the board ; and it was not till after a considerable lapse
os 111110 111111 110 even dared to bring his nose in contact with it.
In doing this, he frequently and suddenly retreated without any
evident reason, and often merely from fiies which he disturbed
by advancing his head. After having on such occasions cau-
tiously snielt the object which caused his fears, he never even
then appeared satisfied with his situation till he had licked 'rt all
over with his tongue, and tried the influence of his teeth upon
such parts as they could be brought to touch.

He appeared now and then fond of exercise; and at such
periods he would run a hundred times, 01· even more, from one
