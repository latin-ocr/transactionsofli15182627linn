In point of size and strength 11115 51160165 falls considerably
short of the Crocum or most common Cape Hyaena. lt usually
mensures about three feet from the forehead to the root of the
11111, 01 a little better than four from the 11056 10 1116 1111 of the
tail. The fore legs are considerably longer than the hindei·
01165; and when perfectly straight and upright, they maintain
the upper parts of the shoulders about two feet four inches from
the ground: on such, 115 well 115 011 111051 011161 occasions, the
head is still higher: and from thence till near the root of the
tail the 11111161 surface of the animal exhibits distinctly an in-
clined plane. 'l'he fore parts are much stronger and more ro-
bustly formed than the 11111116101165, and 1151111110111111 strength
lies in the 511011111615, neck, and head: the latter is throughout
¹strongly constructed, and the upper part is very broad, and
appears even more so than it actually is, on account of the
manner in which the hair, like a ruff, stands out upon ’115 511165
between the ears and the throat. The forehead is deep, slightly
convex, and covered thickly with a rigid short hair, partly black,
partly white, and partly 1611111511-111·011’11,-1111, however, 50 111161-
mixed with each other as to exhibit a sort of grizzled appear-
ance. The lower portion of the face, comniencing at the eyeS.
is much narrowcr than the upper parts, convex, in front 1111111511,
:ll the sides and throughout thinly covered by short, black, and
reddish-white hair. Immediately under the outer angle of each
eye are one or two black spots and black hair, more or 1655 1115-
tinctly in the form of one or 111016 vertical 51111165, 0001115 amongst
the reddish-white sort that forms the ruff-like appearance pre-
viously alluded to as extending between the ears and the throat.
