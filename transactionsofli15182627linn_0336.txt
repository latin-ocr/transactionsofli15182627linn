3120 Mr. VIGORs’s aud Dr. Honspnm's Descriptionofthe

Genus. A NT noc 11AE R Affi‘.

Rostrum elongatum, subattenuatum, subarcuatu1n; culmine ad
basin subcarinato; mamlibuld superiori vix emarginat&
naribus longitudinalibus, linearibus, membranar supra tec-
tis, ad medium rostrum extendentibus ibique apertioribus

Lingua ad apicem in setas plurimas divisa.

Ala mediocres, rotundatae; remige prima brevi secunda tertia
parte longiori, tertia gradatim longiori, quarta quinta et
sexta {equalibus longissimis; tertiae ad septimam inclusam
pogoniis externis in medio gradatim latioribus.

Gamla elongata, rotundatu, vix gradata.

Pedes fortes, longitudine mediocres ; acrotarsiis scutellatis, para-
tam-iis integris.

'l'he strong, but at the same time lengthened and attenuated
bill of this group, added to the size and powerful conformation
of the species, distinguish it from the true ZlIeliplzaga. The
lengthened and subgraduated tail also serves as a strong mark
of distinction. 'l'he chief external characters of the group asso-
ciate it with the Meliplzagidae, although upon a decidedly enlarged
scale: and the tongue of one of the species, now before us,
exhibits the filamentous formation peculiar to the Australian
Honcy-Eatcrs. The genus is closely allied to the last; the same
general character pervades them: but the bill of the present
genus is longer and slenderer‚ and the tail lengthened and some-
what graduated instead of being even, as in Myzcmtlza. There
is a general similarity of colours throughout the group, which
has led, as we suspect, to several species being confounded
together under one denomination.

M. Vieillot has referred this bird to a new genus of his, which
he names Cremlion, and which he divides into two sections: one
