M. Cuvier's genus, it seems calculated to enibrace all the 5136-
6165 of the family which do not belong to the European for1n;
in fact, merely to draw a geographical line of demarcation
between the European and extra-European species. To those
who have had an opportunity of observing the mode in which
the characters of the illus-cicapidae vary in the numberless foreign
51166165 which 116 already 13055655, 1111(1 11111611 1116 daily increasing
our collections, it must be evident that such a wide latitude in-
cludes in the genus illuscipcta a vast variety of forins: while at
1116 same time it affords but little reliefto the student in lessening
the number of species detached from the original ilrluscicapa.

It appears 10 us, however, that some advance will be made 10
1116 111016 1111111110115 arrangement of this family, by restricting the
51366165 of illus-ripeta to those which exhibit the characters ori-
ginally laid down by M. Cuvier for the group, and which accord
with the birds enumerated by him as its 111365. From 111656 we
may perhaps 561661, 1116 111115616011α Paradisi of Linnaeus as the
most conspicuous, and best fitted to point out the characters
which that eminent naturalist designed to particularize. Ue
here perceive a somewhat elongated bill, which appears inter-
mediate with respect to its breadth between the narrower 111115
of the Europe-an Jsascicapcffi and the widely-dilatet] bill of
1'lutffl-lztzsnclzus. The tail also is graduated. The group, 111115
restricted, will contain a number of well-defined specieS, which
at present appear to us proper to Africa and India, and which
more or less accord with this type. ln addition to this group,
we have ourselves already pointed out two other forins among
our New Holland species, which, besides the moditications of
their 131115, exhibit. by the structure of the tail, and the use to
which it is applied, some natural grounds for separation. We
venture in addition to propose another ζ(110111), characterized
above, which we have reason 10 110136 11111 51111 further serve to

afford
