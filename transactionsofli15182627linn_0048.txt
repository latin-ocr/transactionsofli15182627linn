scarcer than formerly. The places most frequented by them
are, W estacre in the former county, and Icklingham in the lat-
teln At both places they are carefully preserved by the pro-
prietors. In the summer of 1819, nineteen of them were observed
together at W estacre. We have twice seen a male Bustard in
the neighbourhood of Burnham. It suffered itself to be ap-
proached to about the distance of a hundred yards, then walked
deliberately a few paces, and took wing without the least diffi—
culty. In fiying it moved its wings slowly‚ more like a Heron
than one of the gallinaceous tribe. Mr. Hardy of Norwich has
more than once succeeded in domesticating this species.

¹3. O. Toto-aa* (Little Bustard).

We have been informed by John Cooper, Esq. of Bungay,
that a female Little Bustard was killed near that town in No-
vember 1804. A bird of the same species was also shot on the
bank of the Ipswich river, near the seat of Sir Robert Harland,
in whose possession it now is.

Genus XXXIX. OEDICNEMUS.
1. O. crepitans (Thick—kneed Bustard).

Genus XL. CALIDRIS.
1. C. arenaria (Sanderling).

The Sanderling visits the eastern coast of England in the
spring, and remains till the autumn. Its toes are fringed with
a widely serrated membrano, which is probably of service in
giving it support upon soft ground. The ssight of this bird is
very placid, and without noise.
