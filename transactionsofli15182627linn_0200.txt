“This birds as we are informed by Mr. Caley, “is called
Nanlceen IIawlc by the settlers. It is a migratory species. My
Ι ¹specimens were shot in May and June 1803. At that time the
species was plentiful; but ever afterwards I observed it but
sparingly. On the Srd of August 1804, Ι made the following
note :ml saw no Naida-een [laedes this autumn—I never observed
it attacking the fowls.''‘'

The species is closely allied to a group which is noted for tho
¹general silnilarity and the corresponding· disposition of its co-
lours; and which includes our Kestril, F. timumcnlus, Linn,
the Κεγχξις of Aristotle ; the newly-characterized European spe-
cies, F. tinmmculoi‹les‚ Temm. ; the African species, F. rupico-
lns, Daud‚; and some others. The group may be observed to
possess a greater shortness of wing· than is usual among the true
Fau-ons,- a character, which points out the passage from those
birds to the. IIazclcs. Our species appears decidedly distinct
from any of the group which we have met with.
