pluniage of the female ; and Mr. Hunt found that the windpipe
of this bird exactly resembled that of the Goosander.

ἱ). M. Serrator (Red-breasted Mei-gamer).

Dr. Hooker purchased a bird of this kind in the inarket at
Norwich. It is not uncommon on the Essex coast.

3. M. albellns (Smew).

It is not uncomnion to meet with Smews on the Suffolk coast

in cold weather; and they were plentiful at Yarmouth in the
winter of 1819-20.

Genus LXVI. CARDO.

1. C. Cormoranus (Cormorant).

2. C. Graculus (Shag).

In an expedition on the Stour, Sept. 30, 1820, we perceived
a bird at a distance swilnming prodigiously fast. By great
exertion we got near it, when it dived and came up two 01· three
hundred yards in our rear. The force and velocity of this bird
in the water were shown by its leaving behind it a white foam-
ing line like the wake of a ship, and which was distinguishable
at the distance of several hundred yards.

Genus LXVII. SULA.
1. S. alba (Gannet).

Dr. Hooker informs us that a young Gannet was taken alive
some years since in the winter season at Pulhmn, and exhibited
at Norwich: it was very fierce. This bird has also been met
with both at Lynn and Yarinouth.
