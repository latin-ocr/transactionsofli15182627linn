M. Yieillot ranks this genus among or near the leruslzes. Its
strong bill, however, inclines us to give it a station among the
&mk-es,- but at that extremity of the family which approaches
the Tlcruslzes. We do 1101 see in this bird any of 1110 leading
characters of Graucalas Cuv., in which genus MM. Quoy and
Gaiinard have placed it. In particular, it wants those sharp and
pointed feathers on 1110 back which distinguish 1110 birds of that
group. In 115 11011115 perhaps, which those naturalists had 1110
11051 opportunity of obsewing, it 111ογ approach Graucalus, and
thus indicate the affinity which 11111105 1110 present subfanlily to
the succeeding, of which that genus makes a part. Our speci-
men was presented to the Society by Mr. Brown, who met with
the species in Keppel Bay‚ August 11111 and October 21st, 1802).
It differs from MNieillot‘s figure in having the back part of the
neck cinereous instead of green‚ and the ends of the lateral tail-
feathers white. Our bird may probably be the male. If it should
prove to be a distinct species, it may appropriately receive the
specific name of Vicillote' after the founder of the genus.
