exter-nal mark of distinction which septu-ates some of the more
slcnder—billed species from the conterminous species of the Cin-
nyriclce.

In addition to the numerous species of this family which
decidedly exhibit most of its typical characters, and which in
their general slenderness of form coincide with the other groups
of the Tenuirostres, there are many species, in which great
size and strength of form is discernible, which have been
ranked as Meliplmgous in consequence of the alleged filamen-
tous conformation of their tongue. Many of these, from their
external characters, might be referred at once to the power-
fully constructed groups of Cor-viche and Illerule'dae. Of some of
these species we can say with confidence that they are Melz?-
plzugous, from our having examined the tongue. But we have
much doubt as to a similar construction of tongue existing in all
the species. We consider it, however, the most eligible plan
to enumerate all these species at the. end of the present family ;
stating our doubts on the subject, and leaving· the question to be
decided by those naturalists who may have the opportunity of
inspecting the birds in their native haunts.

* The species of the family of Meliplmgidae appear very numerous, and every
arrival from New Holland and the Australian islands brings an addition to their nuin-
bcr. At the same time the species themselves are but ill-defined3 and in the present
imperfect state of our knowledge, and while information is daily increasing, we consider
it unadviseable to attempt more than a rude sketch of this interesting family. The
group which we have selected above as representing the BIeliphaga of Lewin and
