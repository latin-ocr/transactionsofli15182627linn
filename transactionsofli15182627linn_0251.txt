deed, almost spurious. Of the foreign groups of the family we
have already observed that the New Holland genera Malea-as
and Acanthiza come nearest the European type by the same
construction of the wing. The present group essentially differs
from it. The first quill-feather is long, almost equal to the
second, which together with the third and foui·th‚—all of them
nearly of a lengtll,—-a1·e the longest. The nares also are linear
and longitudinal, thus differing from the oval form of the Euro-
pean type. In other respects the characters of these two groups
have a general accordance. Besides the disposition of the
wing-feathers‚ we may also mention the scutellation of the tarsi,
the even 11111, and the unarmed rictus, as additional marks of
distinction from the before—mentioned New Ilolland ›S'gslviuclffl
From the genus IIyloplcilus of M. Temminck, which has lately
been separated with 11111611 judgement from the Sylviu of Dr. La-
tham, and which also has the first quill-feather elongated and
nearly even with the rest, our present group may readily be dis-
tinguished by a much more gracile and arcuated bill, in which
the nares also are of a different construction. The illotaeilla
Ilsaclerusputcmu of Linnaeus, (Sylviu lllaclagascaricmis, Lata),
belongs to our group, which seems to have a very wide dis-
persion.
