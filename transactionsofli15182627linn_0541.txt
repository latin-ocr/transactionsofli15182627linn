Division and separation is the end of the artificial system ;—
10 establish agreements is the end of the natural. In one caso
we reason ιὶ prioris in the other (ὶ posteriori. The one 15 a
descending, the other an ascending series. Linnaem under-
stood this distinction when he romarked, “Ordines naturales
valent de natur-:1 plantarum ; artificiales in diagnosi plantarum.'’
—“ Cavendo in imitando naturam filum Ariadneum amittamusl’
Nevertheless it has appeared to me that many modern natu-
ralists have not adopted these truths ; and that it is the prevalent
error of the day to attempt to generalize where they ought to
analyse; while their arrangements, called natural, are almost
all of them framed with a view to distinguish. Let 1116 1101 116
supposed by these remarks to wish to exclude from the natural
system every attempt at diagnosis: for it is obvious, that as 1116
business of the naturalist 15 10 study all the characters„ he can
no more neglect differences than he can agreements. Ι only
wish to point out the two dissimilar objects we have in view,
that they may not be confounded.

M. Decandolle, for instance, whose labours as a systematist
are invaluable, seems to overlook this distinction. In 1115 “ Regni
Vegetabilis Systema Natui·ale,'' he starts from things the least
known, to reason on things best known. He begins his compre-
hensive work with a predicate of the stars; and, proceeding
downwards to mfflerals, comes to plants. Here he employs a
series of 1611115 expressive of a, natural gradation from the highest
to the lowest group, attempting fresh combinations at every stage,
and making a place for every thing. Thus 116 has Clas-5, sub-class,
cohart, order, tribe, genus, section, species. The extraordinary
number of these combinations diminishes their value as a work of
natural arrangement. It is a difficulty of sufficient amount to
establish a few well marked ; and when they are so mustiplied, it

may be suspected that many of them are arbitrary and artificial.
