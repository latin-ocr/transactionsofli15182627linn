Genus XLIII. VANELLUS.
1. V. Melanogaster (Swiss Sandpiper).

This beautiful bird has been met with several times in the
spring of the year at Yarmouth, probably on its passage to its
breeding haunts. It has also been killed at the same place late
in autumn, at which time it has aequired the plumage usually
attributed to the Gray Sandpiper; and it is by no means un-
common on the Essex coast throughout the winter. As the
plumage upon the upper parts of this bird in autumn is inter-
spersed with yellow spots, it assumes at that season a resem-
blance to a Golden Plover. And there can be little doubt that
it was a Swiss Sandpiper in its autumn dress to which Mr. Mark-
wick alludes, when he sayS‚ ‘⁶ I once saw a Golden Plover which
had a small back toe.'’—Limz. Trans. vol. iv. pp. 25, 26.

The ssight of the Swiss Sandpiper is smooth, gentle, and with-
out noise⁷ much like that of the Sanderling3 and it carries its
winus arched in ssight, in the manner of that bird.

2. V. cristatus (Lapwing, Flap-Jaok‚ Hom-Pie).

Genus XLIV. STREPSILAS.
⁷1. S. collaris (Turnstone).
These birds are found sparingly on the sea-coast. We noticed

five of them passing from the Mussel Islands to the main-land

of Essex : they flew in a line one aster the other, and so low as
almost to touch the water.

Genus XLV. CICONIA.
1. C. alba (White Stork).

A few years since a pair of W hite Storks were seen at Gorles-
ton, and one of them was killed. Another pair was observed at

Aclea
