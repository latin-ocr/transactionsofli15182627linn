the same inest. This bird was covered with feathers, and was
able to make some use of its wings. The parent birds had
adapted the food which they brought to their young to their
powers of digestion. The stomach of the first of the above
Sparrows was weak, and filled almost entirely with insects ; only
one grain of wheat and a few grains of sand were found in it.
ln the second the gizzard was become vastly inore muscular,
and contained nine grains of wheat nearly whole, besides some
pieces, the remains os several small beetleS‚ and some pretty
large gravel-stones.

4. F. montana (Tree-Sparrow).

We have received a specimen of the Tree-Sparrow from
the Rev. H. Tilney of Hockwold, at which place it breeds.
Mr. Scales pointed out to us this species at Beechamwell, and
favoured us with its eggs. We have also seen it at Freston in

Suffolk.

6. F. sslontijringilla (Brambling).

This winter bird of passage sometimes makes its appearance
in very large flocks. At Beechamwell, Mr. Scales considered
them of service to his land, from their devouring in great abun-
dance the seeds of the Knot-grass (Polygonum aviculam-e). In the
severe winter of 1819-‘20 large fiocks of these birds were ob-

blings have been observed in the spring as late as the 27th of
April. A male and female, which were only winged, we kept
for some time in a cage, and fed with canary and hemp seed, of
which the former agrees with them best. The male was the larger
