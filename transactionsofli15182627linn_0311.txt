111 honorem Ornithologicc' celeberrimi, Domini C. J. ’1Ἐ1111111Ν6κ,

M. Temminck in his “sslamzel’' refers to a species which he
gives as the type of this genus, and which he describes as dark-
brown above with black spots, the male having a red throat
surrounded with blacl<3 the female With a white throat. W'e
suspect our bird to be the female of this species. M. Temminck
has not named his bird: and we consequently take this oppor-
tunity of assigning it the name of a naturalist, to whom we are
indebted for the characters of 1116 group itself, and for many
other valuable additions to Ornithology.

The Soeiety’s specimen was presented to them by ΜΓ. Brown,
who met with it near IIat Hill in the year 1804.
