188 Mr. Vmon‘s's ancl Dr. HORSFIELD'S Description oftlze

ticularly about the Flats, a. few miles below Paramatta. The

natives tell me it feeds upon dead fish, and the bones (of fish I

apprehend) which they leave. T he Flats is a noted fishing

place for the natives: the water there is shallow, and at ebb-
tide a great portion of sand is lest bare, which, with some marshy
land adjoining, forms a convenient resort for several species of
birds.’'

“ The native name of this bird‚” as Mr. Caley informs us,
‘⁶ is Back'buclc. It may be heard nearly every night during
winter uttering a cry corresponding with that word. Although
this cry is known to every one, yet the bird itself is known but
to few; aud it eost me considerable time and trouble before
I could satisfy lnyself respecting= its identity. 'l'he note of the
bird is soinewhat‘similar to that of the European czwlcoo, and
the colonists have hence given it that name. The lower order
of the soulers in New South lVales are led away by the idea
that every thing is the reverse in that country to what it is in

England ;
