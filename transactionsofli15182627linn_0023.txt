This circumstance shows that they were then migrating, and it
seems highly probable that they came from the Continent.

Genus IV. Bonssxcwom.

1. Β. garrula (Vi'axen Chatterer).

The Waxen Chatterer, though only an occasional visitant, has
not unfrequently made its appearance in these. countieS, and
generally from November to March. Some years since a pro-
digious fiock of them were seen in a grove at Bawdsey in Suf-
folk, by W. W. Page, Esq., then resident at that place. Mr.
Leathes informs us that these birds were in considerable abun-
dance at Herringfieet in the winter of 1810.

Genus V. Co R Acus.

1. C. garrula (Roller).

‘⁴ In the month of May 1811, Sir Thomas Gooch⁷s keeper
shot a female Roller near Benacre 111 Suffolk, on the same spot
where he had killed the male four years since: the ground they
frequented was a coarse sort of 1163111 and fen intermixed.'’—-—B7’2't.
Zool. edit. 1812. In answer to some queries respecting a Roller
killed in Suffolk, Mr. Hunt of Norwich replies, ‘⁶ The specimen
of the Roller, which was shot at. Bungay September 23, 1817, Ι
suspect was a young male bird, as it differs materially in plu-
mage from 3 female one now in my possession. This bird lS
now in the collection of J oseph Sabine, Esq. Ι 3111 also credibly
informed‚ that another specimen of the same bird was killed in
the neighbourhood of Yarmouth about the same time. A few
years since a Roller was shot at Bromeswell in Suffolk. And

late in the spring of 1818 another was killed in the neighbour-
hood of Cromer.”
