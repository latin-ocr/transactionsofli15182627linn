Australian Bit-ds in the Collection of the Limzean Soc-iem. 201

This bird also exhibits so general a resemblance to the pre-
ceding species, that we should at once have referred it to it as a
variety, were it not that it differs in its geographical situation, as
well as in some minuter characters. It is a native of Van Die-
men's Land, where it was met with by Mr. Caley, while the
other species is found in New South VHdes. That gentleman
noted also that the iridcs of the present bird were brown, while
those of Pocl. humeralis were yellow. The chief difference in
their plumage is as follows: The longitudinal streaks on the
head of Pod. humeralis are bold and broad, diffusing a strong
black shade over the head3 those of Pod.C1cz>2·eri are. slender
and more distant from each other, and leave the fuscous-brown
of the head predominant. The Pocl. Czcvieri wants the fulvous
fascia on the shoulder, and the fasciae 011 the tail are not so
strongly marked as in Pocl. humeralis. The bill also of the Van
Diemen’s Land bird is somewhat shorter than the bill of the
other. We have seen a few other specimens of Pod.Cavie1·2
which came from the same locality as our specimen ; as also
some other birds of the New South NVales speeies: and those
leading marks of distinction stated above seemed constant be-
tween them. At the same time we must observe, that there
appeared much variation in the different speeimens of each of
these supposed species: and we consequently cannot speak
with the same certainty respecting the difference of species 111
this group, as in groups less subject to variation. W'e therefore
state our doubts on these points, while we follow the general
plan which we have prescribed for ourselves in all such doubtful
cases, of keeping apparent species distinet, until proof is given
of their being,= identieal.

Mr. Caley calls all these birds by the native name of Benit’.
He observes that they are night birds, and seem stupified when
found upon the wing by day.
