If the attempt is to be at present made, the most obvious
ground which could be immediately proposed, is that. which was
rejected by Willdenow ; the presence and form ot' the nectary or
disk encompassing the ovary. In many species of Amyrc's it is,
as a nect-ary or glandular ring, wanting; being only shadowed
or represented by a fleshy receptacle 01· continuons podogyninm
elevating the germ and receiving the filaments and petals 111-
serted in its foot. In other instances the nectary is clearly pre-
sent, consisting in a glandular ring, which girds the base of the
germ, distinct from the receptacle beneath it, in which the sta-
mina and petals are inserted. It is discriminated from that by
a (listerence of form and appearance, or more simply separated
by a contraction or intermediate strangnlation. In some in-
stances the annular receptacle of the germ or nectarial ring is
crennlate3 in others it is distinctly glandular; in a few it is
merely protuberant.

The total absence of a nectary, and consequent restriction of
the common receptacle of stamina and petals below and germ
above to a simple podogynium, might serve to characterize one
gronp in this family. Many species of Amystis belong to it:
among them may be enumerated several Indian sorts, as damna,
A. acuminata, and -si.pe›1taphylla of Roxburgh.

A crenulate ring occurs in Bur-sera serrata ; and this form of
the nectary intimatos analogy with Boswellia, which has a crenu-
late fleshy cup, in the exterior margin whereof the stamina are
inserted. That analogy is strengthened by the examination of the
seed, which exhibits in both instances multilobed and intricately
folded cotyledons. 'i he presence of a crennlate nectary‚ there-
fore, might be taken for the. discriminative mark of one more
gronp‚—a link in the chain from the first-mentioned towards
Boswellia.
