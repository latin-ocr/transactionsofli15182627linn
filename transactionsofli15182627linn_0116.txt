104 Dr. FRANCIS HAMILTON'S Commenlary

that I know ς yet in the number of parts, and even structure of
the most essential organs, such as the antherae, there are great
differences existing between different species; which shows the
impropriety of founding new genera on differences of number, or
even of structure in minute parts, however essential, where there
are no corresponding differences in habit or general appear-
ance.
BLATTJ, p. 43. tal). 40.

Both Rheede and his commentator considered this as 11 species
of Engcnia, to which it no doubt has some affinity, although this
is not very striking. No further notice, except a slight one by
Camelli published by Ray, was taken of this plant, until Rum-
phius described it under the name of [llanginm cas-colare (Herb.
Amh. iii. 111.), without however noticing its being the Blatti of
Rheede. This, indeed, is done in the observation annexed by
Burman, 113, who says that Rumphius noticed the identity of
the plants ; but I have not discovered where he says so. Rum-
phius divides the Mangiunz caseolare into two kinds2 album,
figured in tab. 73, and rubrum, figured in tab. 74. 'l'he only diffe-
rence, however, which he mentions is, that the former has round,
and the latter quadrangular branches: ‘⁶ Ejus (Al. cas. rubri)
ramuli non sunt rotundi, sed quadrati, 01 quasi alati, 1111 111 oras
gerant acutas :’' and in fact the figure (74.) represents the branches
of this sorm, while in tal). 73 they are round. This (111101-01100, l
suspect, is not to be relied upon as sufficient: for in the plants
which I have seen, both on the banks of the Ganges and of the
Erawadi, the description of Rheede 15 perfectly applicable:
‘⁵' Rami et surculi teneriores quadranguli—-vetustiores vero alis
privati ac rotundiores,'’ as may be observed in the specimens
from the Ganges which 1 have deposited in the library at the
India IIouse. One circumstance, however, might seem to indi-
cate some difference between 1110 plants of Rheede and Rum—

phius.
