The only specimen of this bird contained in the Society’s eol-

It is however sufficiently preserved to show the genus to which
it belongs, and to afford a clear specific distinction. The bill
has all the characters of that of the true Capriuzchucs, being
weak‚ narrowed. and much compressed at the aper, with round
and elevated nostrils ε the legs also, like those of the same genus,
are short, weak, and feathered to the toes, which are uneven,

name has been derived. But the plumage of the abdomen, and
of the under-parts generally, is defective. Mr. Caley informs
us that the bird was picked up dead on his premises in its pre-
