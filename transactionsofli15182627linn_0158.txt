146 Dr. FnANC1s HAMILToN'S Commentary

laterales inseruntur, glandulani habent parvam planam,
quam in Ava non innotui. Fructus maturus magnitudine
Grossulariae ovatus, flavus, ore saepius quinquedentato.

This last plant, on account of the erectness of the stem, comes
nearest the I'alli 'l'cregam, from which it differs chiefly in being
rougher and in having smaller fruit: but Ι must confess that
these appear to 1116 slight circumstances for establishing distinct
species.

W'illdenow, wishing perhaps to avoid the ambiguity of two
plantis having been named Ficus secter-oplqslla, abandoned this
name altogether: and for the plant so named by the younger
Linnaeus‚ that is, the l'allc' Tei-egam, adopts Kocnig's specific
name aquatica (Sp. Pl. iv. 11:33), which leads me rather to
suspect that his specimens belonged to the plant which I have
called Heus (lweticalatm sor this grows in places which are
occasionally inundated: but Rheede says that the Valli Tere-
gam grows 111 woods. It must be also observed, that Willdenow
did not see the figs of his plant, on the form of which the diffe-
rence between the Ficm (lenticulam and the I'alli Ter-egam chiefly
depends. M. Poiret however (Eue. Melle. Sap. ii. (548), and
Dr. Roxburgh (Ilm-t. Beng. (55.) retain the name lteleropllylla
for the Valle? Tcregam, the Ficus lzclcropltgslla of M. Lamarck
being by M. Poiret called Ficus resfesccns.

On the whole, the. Ficus denticulata, F. repens, and F. aqzzalica
are distinguished by circumstances of no great consequence:
and perhaps the F. truncata of Wl'illdenow (Sp. Pl. iv. 1132.) 15
1101 very materially different; and all are nearly connected with
the F.G1·0ssulari0idcs of Burman, now almost forgotten (Eue.
Meth. Sul). ii. (557), although it was the species first introduced
into the modern system of botany.
