continue to receive, so much benefit from Mr. MacLeay,—when

Ordol. RAPTORES. Ill„

Fam. VULTURIDAE.

'I'he first order which meets our attention, as the first division
01 the Typical Groztp in OrnithoIogy, is the Raptorial Orcler, or
the Biz-ds qf'PreJs. Of these birds, again, the first subdivision
that comes before US, as being¹ the first department of the Tsssffl'ffll
Group of that order, is the family of sultariclce. Of this family
the Society's collection possesses no specimen z nor have we as
yet seen any species of it from New Holland. Dr. Latham, how-
ever, describes two species as natives of that country: but we
have much doubt whether they will be found to appertain to thc
Vultur-es. One of these, his Now [Iollancl Vultur-e, seems to have

and, as far at least as can bejudged froin a figure, bears a greater
resemblance to a Wacling Bird than to a Bircl of Prey. The
second species, the Vultur audaoe of the ‘⁶ Indea- Ornithologicus,”
which its distinguished author seems not to have described

to be uncertain, does not appear to possess any characters in

attack the natives the1nselveS,-—a circumstance, indeed, from

whence it has derived its specitic name,—we can scarcely feel
