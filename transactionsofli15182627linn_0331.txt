‘⁴ This bi1·d‚” Mr. Caley says, ‘⁶ is called Golden-Effe by the
settlers. I shot it at Iron Cove, seven miles from Sydney, on
the Paramatta road.''—Specimens of the species now in the eol-
lection were brought by Mr. Brown from Port Jackson.

9. INDISTINCTA. llsel. suprr} olivaeeo-fusca, subtus sordid& al-
hida, remigibusflavescentibus.

This bird, which was found by Mr. Brown at King George's
Sound, on the South coast of New Hossand, appears closely
allied to the last. It is however in very bad condition, and
scarcely admits of a description. The dimensions appear nearly
the same as those of Mel. lzueulata. It has much of the appear-

ance of a young bird.

10. Bnnvmos'rn rs. Mel. brunnescenti-fusea, subtus albida, dorso
virescenti, striga postoculari albi}7 rostro subbrevi.

²* This section of our gronp corresponds with the genus llIelillzreptus of M. Vicillot3
at least the Mel. tumulata, one of the best known species in the section, is glvcn as one
of the types of that genus. We (lo not know how far M. Vieillot meant to extend his
group3 but it may be adviseable hereafter to restrict it to those species which will

arrange themselves in the present section.
