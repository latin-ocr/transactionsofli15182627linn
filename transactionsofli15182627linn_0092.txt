The elder Burman (Thes. Zeyl. 131.) borrowed from Hermann
the name Palma :eylanicc1, folio longissimo et latissimo, by no
means so characteristic as that of Ray; for, as I have said, in
its full growth the leaves are not remarkably larger than those
of the Borassns.

Ruinphius (Ilerb. Amb. i. 44.) compared the leaves of the Codda
Panna with those of his Sca-ibus, but says “ verum tantum differt
ut diversa sit habenda species.” (See my Commentary on the
Herium-ium Αηώοὶηεηδσ.) Notwithstanding what Rumphius had
properly observed, Linnaeus in the Flora Zeylanictt (394.) joined
the *S'arilms with the Coclsla Panna to form his Coryplea: but it
was probably the latter that 116 11163111 10 describe, as we have 110
reason 10 believe that the Saribus is found in Ceylon. In the
Species Planum-um and Burman's Flora Indica (240.) no change
took place, except giving to the Coryplza the specific name um-
lnnculffera, and without any good reason omitting some of the
synonyma. (333111161- continued the error ; nor do Ι know which
of the fruits he described.

After this long· continuance of error, the difference between
the Sarihus and Codcla Panna was pointed out by M. Lamarck
(Eric. Meth. ii. 130), who considered the latter as the Coryphe
117nh7·acul{fera‚ and in this has been followed by Willdenow. (Sp,
Pl. ii. 201.)

There is no figure of this plant, and the description is so im-
perfect that little dependence can be placed on such conjectures
as I 0311 offer. It is probably a palm growing in or close by the
rivers of Malabar 3 and as 1116 description says, “ folia Palmae
