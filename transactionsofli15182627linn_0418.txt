the surface. In its stomach, intestines, and caecal appendages,
the Golden Eye is also intermediam, the latter being only
two inches in length. In the Goosander these appendages are
three inches; but the size of the bird being considered, reduces
them on a comparative estimate· to less than two: in the Red-
breasted Merganser they are but one inch 3 the Smew is without
any. In the form of its trachea, the Golden Eye more closely
resembles the Mergansers than that of any other Duck, by the
enlargement in the tube, and in the shape of the labyrinth, as a
reference to Dr. Latham's representations will show. Thus the
whole of the numerous species of the Anatidce appear to descend
to the more perfect water-birds by gradations, but with well-
marked divisions throughout.

How far I am correct in an arrangement not strictly in acu
cordance with the published systems of ornithdogists, Ι must
leave to better judges to (letermine; assuming, however, that
an arrangement will be the more natural according to the pro·
portion in which it combines ascertained habits, external cha-
racters, and anatomical structui·e²“†³.
