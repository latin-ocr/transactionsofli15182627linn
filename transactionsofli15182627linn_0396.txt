could take place : for there was no appearance of an opening at
the extremity of the puparium (Ka-by), nor could I detect the
reproductive organs in the thoracic portion of the body, which
might have been approached inter nuptias. While engaged 111
pressing 111111 examining the male organs under the micro-
scope, I discovered the extensile 0511011111)Γ of the penis, ad-
mirably adapted by its extraordinary length and flexibility for
the sexual intercourse, which appears to terminate in the. de-
51111011011 os the 1111110. [t is highly improbable that the perfect
11150015 hare been seen in l⁴lurope; for 110 5001101· 11115 1110 male
11115011 from 1115 pupal slumber, than he beginS, even before the
full expansion of his wings, to flutter about with so much vio-
101100 that 1115 beauty has commonly disappeared before 1110 011-
10111111011151 can secure him. It 15 well known to the European
11111111111151, 111111 1110 female< os several Lepidopterous insects are
nearly apterous: but Ι believe all at present described possess
the 11111111101115 of xvings and antennae, with perfect feet. The
female of Plzalsena (melitina of Linn.‚ which I have often collected
when 11 boy, not only quits 1110 folliculus, but, copztldjzmcta, en-
joys with 115 1111111101· 1110111011511105 of the open fields. Here,
however, we have an animal which 111 115 adult state 15 for ever
exeluded from the light, and never even beholds the mate to
which it 15 indebted for 115 progeny. After impregnation, the
female begins to till the bottom of its puparium with her ova
closely packed in the down rubbed from her body ; and having
performed this duty, either presses herself through the thoracic
carina, reduced to a shrivelled morsel of dried and scarcely ani—
mated skiii, or dies within the case.

’[’110 young soon force their way out of the puparium which
had served for the defence of the ova, 111111 spreading about the

1100 (1111 innumerable host), prepare themselves an habitation
before their first repast.
