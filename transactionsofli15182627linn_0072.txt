Genus LXVIII. COLYMBUS.
]. C. glacialis (Northern Diver).
In the beginning of last winter two young birds of this species

were killed on the river at Yarmouth. One of them is now in
Mr. Sabine's collection.

Q. C. arcticus (Black-throated Diver).

ὃ C. septentrionalis (Red-throated Diver).

We have seen specimens of the Red-throated Diver in Nor-
folk, both in its full plum-age and also in its speckled state : and
ΜΓ. IIunt says that it is not uncommon at Yarmouth during the
winter.—'I¹he position of the feet of Divers at the extremity of
the body, and their horizontal motion, enable them to make
rapid turns under water in pursuit of their inppery prey.

Genus LXIX. Uim.
1. U. Troilo (Foolish Guillemot).

9. U. Grylle (Black Guillemot).

3. U. Alle (Little Auk).

Some years since a Little. Aul< was taken alive in the stac-k-
yard of the late ΜΓ. Webb of Pulham, which place is more than
twenty miles distant from the sea. Mr. Leathes has had two
specimens of this bird, one of which was taken alive on the
turnpike-road at Gnnton near Lowestoffe; and Miss Lloyd of

IIintlesham has one now in her possession which was taken out
of the belly of a Codfish.
