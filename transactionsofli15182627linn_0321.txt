These birds, which now generally are considered the sexes of
one species, appear to be but accidental visitors in the colony.
At least Mr. Caley informs us that he never met with more than
two individuals of the male and one of the female. The male
specimen in the Society’s collection seems to be a young bird
changing to the adult plumage. It. has several pale ferrugineus
feathers on the lower parts of the body, and it has a single fer-
ruginous feather striated with black among the secondary quill-
feathers of the right wing, which forins a striking contrast with
the deep black of the rest. The corresponding feather on the
left wing was lost, as Mr. Caley tells us, by the shot striking
the wing. This bird had berries of Cassytlui in its stomach.
The native name of the male is Cozcbat'3 of the female, 13qu

litigiug.
