afford some assistance towards the subdivision of the family. In
it the bill, like that of the group to which we would restrict the
name of illuscipeta, is intermediate in breadth between the bills
of the true Meiscicapa and Platyrliynclms. It is at the same time
moderately short: in which it differs from the bill of Mic-scipefa.
'l'he tail is even, by which character it may be also distinguished
from the latter genus3 and moderate in 16118111, by which it is
separated from the equally even but long—tailed ,S'e‘mn-a. In
drawing a line between the species of this family we are inclined
to lay much stress upon the structure of the tail. Nearly allied
as the whole group is to the Fissirostral Bit-(ls- which feed upon
the wing,
111 1116 311, 3 member which, like the tail‚ contributes to their
powers of 1118111, or support upon the wing, must be considered
as of much importance: and in a numerous family like that

before us, which calls for subdivision, and in which no stronger

and being themselves accustomed to seize their prey

mark of distinction is tangible, 11 appears to us that the variations
in the structure of the tail afford not merely a convenient arti—
116131 ground of separation, but one which is sufficiently natural.
'she group, as we have at present characterized it, does not
appear to be peculial· to New Holland. Some American spe-
cies, such as the lllzescicapa querula and M. rapam of Wilson’s
“ Ornitleology,⁷' appear to belong 10 11.
