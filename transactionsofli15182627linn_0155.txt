The yminger Burman (ΓΙ. [ud. 2¹27.) established a new species
of Ficus, which he called (J'rOss-nlarioislcs. This consisted ot' two
varieties; and the first was a plant described by Gai-cin, which
having poisonous fruit, as well 115 many external differences,
would appear to be a distinct species from the second variety,
which 15 1116 ἷίἰίίὲ Tercgam. The younger Linnaeus (Sap. 442.)
would seem to have 56611 11115 1111161· plant, and called it Ficus
lwterophgslla. M. Lalnarck (Enc. lllctlz. ii. 499.) 1110601611 from
111. Sonnerat speciniens of a plant, which notwithstanding 501116
differences, he considered as the 1³. leete›·0pl1ylla; and, although
116 quotes 1116 Hortus sssalabariczes with doubt, 11611565 the descrip-
tion contained in this work to make up a full account, joining
what he saw in 1115 5116011116115 10 what he found in Rheede, a
practice that cannot fail to lead into mistakes. There 15 indeed
great reason to think, on account os the 111111111655, 111111 1115 spe-
cimens were like those which Dr. Roxburgh 56111 10 Willdenow,
and which he pnblished under the name of Ficus repens (Sp. Pl.
iv. 1149). Of 11115, M. Poiret (Eue. slsetlz. Sap. ii. (348.) 11115
become 5611511116, 1111(1 116 considers the Ficus lecteroplnslla ot'
M. Lamarck as the Ficus rzgfescens of Yahl. On my return to
Calcutta from Ava (1796) specimens and a drawing ot' this, under
the name of Ficus repens, were 56111 10 1116 11116 Sir Joseph Banks,
and a copy of 11115 drawing 15 10 116 found in the libi-ary at the
India House. I have since 11150 lodged in the. 5111116 collection
specimens from India Proper, under the 11111116 ot' Ficus rafim-cens.
These differ a little from 1110 plant found in Ava; but not 50
much as to warrant their being considered 115 forming a distinct
species, as will appear from the following account.
