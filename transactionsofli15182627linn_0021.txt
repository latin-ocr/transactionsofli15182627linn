the Rooks to deserta rookery in the same grove, which they had
previously frequented for many years.

2. C. Corone (Crow).

We have often been much amused with the sagacioris instinct
of this bird, and of others of the same genus, in getting at their
prey. In the winter season they frequent the sea-shores during
the ebb tide in search of museles and other shell-fish. As soon
as the bird has found one, it fiies up almost perpendicularly into
the air, with the fish in its beak, and lets it fall on the stones in
order to break its shell‚ The bird quickly follows the falling
booty, and devours it.

The eggs of the Crow are subject to vary both in shape and
colour. Two of them in our possession, taken from the same
nest, differ considerably3 one being of a pale green with very
few small spots, and the other almost entirely covered with large
dusky spots.

3. C. Cornix* (Hooded Crow).

The Hooded Crow made its appearance in this country in the
year 1816 as early as October 9th. They are very common in
Suffolk on heaths. Sometimes they will approach the habita-
tions of man, and feed upon the carrion preserved for dogs.
This species is rather numerous in the neighbourhood of Yar-
mouth during the winter, feeding among the ooze at low-water:
it is also frequently seen on the road between that place and
Norwich.

4. C.frugilegus (Rook).
The eggs of the Rook are very good to eat, and by some per-
sons have been thought equal to those of the Lapwing. Like

those of the Crow, they are sometimes seen of a pale green,
