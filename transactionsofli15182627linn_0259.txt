Auso-alian Bircls in tlzc Collection oftlze Linncan Society. 243

Society’s collection accord very closely With the general charac-
ters of that type. The construction of the bill is nearly the
same: in our birds that member being only in a slight degree
longer and more gracile. The wing has the same formati0n3
the first quill-feather being short, and the second and third
gradually exceeding it; the only difference discernible in this
member is, that in the European bird the fourth feather is the
longest, while in ours the fifth rather exceeds the fourth. The
legs and feet afford ‘no mark of distinction ; unless, perhaps, we
should say that in our birds the tarsi are somewhat longer.
These slight differences do not exhibit sufficient ground for
separation between the birds of these distant countries; par-
ticularly as there is a striking resemblance in the disposition os
their colours. We may, for instance, trace the white front,
and the white markings on the Wings and tail of M. atricapilla
in the Australian species. There are several species described
by authors as belonging to New Holland‚ the description of
whose colours approaches very nearly to that of the birds before
us. We have not seen these birds, but consider it probable that
they belong to the same group.

We have referred this bird to the red-bellied Flycatcleer of
Dr. Latham, although that species does not possess the white
markings on the wing-coverts or the tail which are seen in our
bird, as far at least as we can judge both from the figure and de-

scription given by that gentleman. Such differences in the white
