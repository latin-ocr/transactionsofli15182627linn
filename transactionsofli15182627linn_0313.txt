The species of the Linnean group of Sitta, although few in
number, appear to be found in all parts of the globe. 'I'hey
exhibit little differences among themselves in general characters.
Our New I‘Iolland species perhaps deviates from the type of the
genus, if we consider the S. Europaea of Linnaeus to hold that
rank, more than any other species of the group. Its bill is more
slender, and its wings more acuminated. The second quill-
feather is nearly as long as the third, fourth, and fifth, which
are almost equal, and it is longer than the sixth; whereas in
the European species the same feather is much shorter than the
third, and also falls short of the sixth. The Javanese species,
S. frontalis, Horsf., approaches our bird most nearly in respect
to these characters of the bill and wings. While the North
American bird, S. Carolinensis, Briss„ has nearly the same
formation of wing as our species, but has the stronger and more
lengthened bill of the European bird.
