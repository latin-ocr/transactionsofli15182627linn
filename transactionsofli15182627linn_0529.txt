osan Orang Otang. 477

of the former. It exceeds ours in height by 6 11161163, having an
altitude of 4 feet 5 inches instead of3 feet 11 z yet, as its arms
each measure 39 inches and a half, instead of 37 inches, and as
its chest is broader, its relative height to that of its reach Ι find
to be precisely the same‚—the latter being a little under S feet.
In its length from the summit of its head to the extremity of the
os coccygis, it is exactly the same as ours, being <2 feet 2 inches :
and the length of its hindei· hands is precisely similar, being 12
inches. Its bones are however thicker and stronger in propor-
11011, 1116 head of the humerus measuring 6 inches and 0116-
eighth in circumfelence, and that of the 611631 111 1116 lower part
of the sternum no less than 57 inches.

In regard to the relative length of the arms in the Pongo and
the Satyrus, it stands thus. In the Satyrus, when young, the
fingers may be observed literally to drag upon the ground like
those of the Gibbons, though the creature be placed erect ; while
in the Pongo 1116 fingers scarcely reach to the external lnaleolus.
Slight differences of this kind undoubtedly take place during the
growth of 111111111113 ; yet those who suppose the Pongo to be the
adult animal„ must be prepared to contend for a much greater
change 111 1116 relative proportions of parts during growth than
can be admitted in other cases. Having mentioned the erect
position, it is almost unnecessary to add, that it is altogether
unnatural to these creatures; and that although we see their
skeletons constantly distorted into human attitudes, one grand
characteristic between them and us is the impossibility of their
thigh-bone being brought, by fair means or by the action of their
own muscles, into the same line as that of the spine. In all in-
ferior creatures‚ it is observed to form with it an angle of greater
or less magnitude, which is the most convincing of all proofs,
that their hindei· extremities alone were never destined for the

support of their bodies.
