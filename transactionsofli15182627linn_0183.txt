and its surface covered with fine granulated papillae. The base
of the bill is covered with a cere, but not coloured; the pupil
of the eye round and black, the irides brown, surrounded exter-
nally with a narrow ring of black.

The legs are gray, rather short for the size of the bird, and
armed with one awl-shaped spur upon each.

The plumage is a handsome mixture of gray, li ght-brown‚ and
black ; the first being limited to the head, the breast, and part
of the abdomen. The brown prevails on all the upper parts
(except the head), and the feathers are margined with lunate-
shaped bars of black, extending to the superior coverts of the
tail. This last is cuneiform, consisting of twelve or fourteen
unequal feathers, lying in two inclined planes, the two middle-
most greatly longer than the others, and all handsomely crossed
with straight bars of black on a light-brown ground.

The colour of the head is darker, inclining to black ; and from
the crown of the head to the occiput rise a few long slender
’ feathers with broader tips, forming a crest inclined backward.

This bird bears the Bengal climate very well, and with little
care and trouble might be brought alive to England. The hen
differs but little from the male‚—wanting the crest and spuis,—
and the females yet seen wanted the two long feathers of the
tail.
