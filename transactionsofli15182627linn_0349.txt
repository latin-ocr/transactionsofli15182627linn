Dr. Housman on α Species of Ursnsfrom Nepaul. 333

they are on both feet covered, and partly concealed at the base,
by thick bristly hairs, closely applied and directed forwards.

The general colour of the hairy covering of the specimen
presented to the Society is tawny‚ or very pale reddish-brown,
with an obscure tint of din-ty yellow, verging to isabella. It is
almost uniform 011 every part. On the top of the head, tufts of
a lighter colour, almost white, are mixed with the rough curls
covering these parts. The under parts of the neck appear to
have been of a darker hue ; but the muzzle is scarcely different
from the posterior parts of the head. 'l'he tail is about an incl]
long. 'l'he relatixe proportion os the extremities and of the
body and neck cannot be ascertained with accuracy; and as
the skin is not sufficiently perfect for being set up, several other
characters remain for future inquiry: the chief of these are,
the form of the head, the character of the nose and lips, the
situation of the eyes, the vibrissae, and the length and proportion
of the ears.

Our animal is of a habit decidedly different from that of
several species of Ursus from the same part of the world, which
have recently been added to the systematic CatalogiieS‚ namely,
the Ursus Tibctanus, the Ursus labiatzzs, and the Ursus Malay-
anns: All these have a Jet-black fur, a semilunar mark of a
white colour on the breast, and other peculiarities affording
types of subgenem, among which Procliilus and Helarctos
have been defined. Our animal, on the contrary, appears to
resemble the European Bears in its structure, as far at least as
can be determined from the parts which have been preserved
in the specimen. Among these, the c'laws afford the best means
of comparison ; they are small, obtuse, and straight, while those
in the. Asiatic ]‘›ears above-mentioned are large, strongly-curved,
acute, and fitted for climbing.

The coloni· of our animal appears to be peculiar, and its size
