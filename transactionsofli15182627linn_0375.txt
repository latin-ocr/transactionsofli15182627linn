remarked concerning that generic description, that ‘⁶ the cap-
sule is 23 3-‚ 4η or 5-seeded; and that the genus differs from
Amyris only in the sessile stigma and arilled seed 'lffl''

Yet Willdffliow, whose remark it is, has annexed to Amyre's
all the laicas of Aublet‚ in every one of which the seeds are en-
veloped in proper arilliform pulp ; and the style is so obscure in
111050, as in several other species referred to Amyris, (particularly
A.J)0lygamcz‚ A. pentaplzylla, A. acuminata, and A. ηαηα, 1101111),
that the stigma may well be deemed sessile in divers plants os
both genera.

The rest of the characters are not less indeterminate. Amyrc‘s
polyganm, as the name imports‚ has unisexual fiowers. This 111-
deed has been transferred to another genus (Sabinus dependens of
Ortega). But Amyris Kataf of Forskal appears also to be poly-
gamons; and so do A. acuminata and A. agalloclza of Roxburgh.
While several Bur-seras exhibit no unisexual blossoms. Amyris
Z'egslanica is described as hexandrous: and A. decamlra, as 1110
5ρο01110 name indicates, presents decandrous fiowers: and so
does another which I shall describe, and which I take to belong
to the same family with the Anzgsrides‚ or at least with those of
Roxburgh. More than one of the plants which have been re-
ferred to this genus are variable‚ like Burseni gummzfera, in the
number of stamina and their corresponding proportion of petals
and calycine divisions.

The berry of Amyris varies as much in respect of the num-
ber of mature seeds contained in it, as the capsule of Bursera.
Nor is the distinction of the pericarp, implied by those names,
well founded in this instance. They are alike coriaceous and
