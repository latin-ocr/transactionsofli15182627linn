458 Mr. Emeum LL’s Observations to ascertain

From the eylindrical figure of the phial, it follows that all the
lines attached to its sides by their extremities, such as were ver-
tical alone excepted‚ formed with those sides chords to arcs of
various 1nagnitudeS. Lowering itself from one of these chords
to another, and applying the spinners to each in 511000551011, 1110
spider soon connected the whole of them together by a line;
then ascending again to the greatest altitude it could attain, and
dropping down by a thread to the bottom of the phial, over
which it walked to the opposite side: it there drew the thread
tight. and made it fast, having prevented it srom coming in con-
tact with the glass previously by raising the abdomen a little.
To this oblique line it united otherS, extending them in different
directions, till by these means it established a communication
with every partos the phial. As there was 501110 difficulty 111
tracing these operations with the unassisted eye, 1011505 of the
magnifying powers of six and eight were employed.

The spiders seen ascending into the atmosphere on the lst of
October were of two distinet 51100105 ; but as the technical diffe-
rence of insects has engaged only a small share of my attention,
I shall leave the task of identifying them to those who are more
familiar than lnyself with this branch of entomology. The sub—
joined remarks on some of the characteristics of these 11150015,
which are more conveniently illustrated by the pen than the
11011011, may serve 10 facilitate 11115 object.

One species has four os its eight eyes much larger than the
other four. Two pair situated in the front or fore-part of the
head are arranged thus , the relative 51Ζο of the dots being
nearly the same as that of the eyes. The other pair of small
01105 15 placed in the upper part of the head, and on each side of
it one of the remaining pair of large eyes 15 seated. 'l'his spider
has the abdomen rather depressed; the anterior 11111115, which it
raises in a menacing manner when any thing approaches 11, are

longer
