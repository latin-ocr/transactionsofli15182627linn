tlement afterwards known by the name of Paramatta. The
native name of the bird is Bunclullocls.

“ The natives inform me it always breeds in dead trees, chiefly
on farms, making its nest with feathers in the body of the hol-
low tree. To whatever depth the tree may be hollow, the bird
always descends to the bottom, like an Opossnm. Its nest is
found by watching the old bird3 and sometimes by hearing the
young ones in the hollow of the tree on passing by. It has six
young ones; the eggs are white without spots.

‘² It may frequently be seen in small flocks along with the
King's Pam-ot (Pl. scapulatus) and the Lot-y (Pl. Pemzsmtii) in
fields of Indi-dn corn : but I never recollect it taking the corn from
the stalk like the 011161· two birds, and I suspect 11 only picks up
what the others throw to the ground. Ι have seen the most of
this species on new-sown wheat early in the morning ; but never
in large flocks. Ι do not recollect ever to have seen the Kingls‘
Pan-rot or Lory pulling up the young wheat like this bird. All
three species are caught in traps. They are very good 61111110·η
