ing it gives superior strength and solidity to that foundation
upon which it is constructed: in fact, it seems always to give
rise to observations even more beautiful than those from which
it has resulted. Thus it was, that in attempting a natural ar—
rangement of the insects collected in „lava by Dr. Horsfield, I
discovered that the niore deeply I penetrated into the science of
affinities, the more broken up was the tarsal system. Still, with
that respect which we naturally indulge for notions generally
adopted, I have confined myself in the first number of the
Annulosa Javanica to my individual observationsffi, without ven—
turing to suppose that the French school of entomologists and
their followers could be essentially wrong in the very ground—
work of their favourite system. Although my c'onfidence in the
observations of these naturalists was far from being so implicit
as it had been, the reader of the first sixty pages of the above-
mentioned work will perceive that, instead of attacking the divi-
sions of Dimcra, Trimero, Sec. generally, I contented myself
with proving my affinities as it were in spite of them; as, for
instance, where I admit the Erotyli, generally speaking, to be
tetramerous, while proving their immediate affinities to be pen-
tamerous. I had scarcely, however, corrected the press of the
tirst number of that work, when Captain P. P. King, R. N. one
of those enterprising and accomplished navigators who at the
present moment confer so much honour on our country, requested
me to examine the inseets which he had collected during his late
expedition to survey the coasts of New Holland. Among the
new forms of Coleoptera in this collection I found a pentamerous
insect, which I have since named illegamerus Kirzgii†, and
