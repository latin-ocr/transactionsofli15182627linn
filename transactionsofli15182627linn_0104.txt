92 Dr. FnANcis HAMIL‘roN’s Commentary

can, with any certainty, be said to represent the Kalon Tsjalca,
both having the pedunculus niuch too long, and therefore both
agreeing with M. Lainarck's ligure ε yet, as the second figure in
Runiphius resembles most M. Lamarck's figure, I should quote
for his N. orientalis the Baucalzcs media (Herb. Amb. iii. 84. t. 55.
f· 2·)

When I returned froin Ava to Calcutta (1796), Ι know that
Dr. Roxburgh considered the Kalon 'I’sjalca as the Nazcclea ori·
entalis, and under that name sent it to the Kew (jarden, where
it still reinains (Hert. Kew. i. 3(1)’6.); but Dr. Roxburgh has
since (Ilm-t. Beng. 14.) left out altogether the A: orientalis and
Kalon Tfjalsa ‚· and the plant which he and l considered as such,
or at least one very like it, he calls Naue-lea. Cadamba. For this
he may have. had different reasons. In the first place, Gaertner
(De Sem. i. 151. t. 30. f. 8.) has, I have little doubt, described
the fruit of Dr. Roxburgh's Akila-lca ])(17·v{fblia (Hort. Beng. 14.)
115 that of the. N. orientalis. 'Phe synonyma, however, which he
quotes are totally erroneous : for his plant 11115 sessile capitula;
but those of both Kalon Tfjalca and Bancalas are pedunculated.
In the next place, although I think it probable that the Katoa
Tsjulm is called Kadam in the vulgar, and Kadamba in the
sacred dialect of Uangetic India ; and although, no doubt,
Dr. 'mxburgh's Caslamlm is the same word, yet the same names
are given to what I take to be the Arbor noctis 5. Bancalusfoemina
ct latg'fblia 01111111111111115(Πανί). Αηιὸ. 111. 84. t.54.)‚which although
very like indeed to what I consider 115 1116 Kalon Tfjalca, yet 11115

given by Rheede, who' says, “ fructus globosi virides sunt, qui
dein rubicundi, tandemque nigricantes et fragiles evadunt; et si
asperius tractentur, facile solvuntur, ac in plures oblongos virides
nitentes folliculos secedunt.’' Now I think that the folliculi
nitentes iniply capsules, such 115 described by Gaertner, although
