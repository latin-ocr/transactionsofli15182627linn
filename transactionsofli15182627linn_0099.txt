Calyx monophyllus, ore tridentato cyathiformis. Petala tria,
subrotunda, in globum ore patulo convoluta. (im-mina tria,
oblonga. Stylz' subulati. Stigmata acuta.

Drupa, vel potius forte bacca (germinum duobus abortivis), 50-
litaria, ovata, Dactylo Arabico dimidio minor, flava, mollis,
carnosa, calyce persistente infra cincta. Cortex· membra—
naceus, tenuissimus. Caro crassiuscula, dulcedine quadam
austera.

I may here observe that, besides the Katou Inclcl, Ι have seen
in India three other species of the same genus ; one of them a
small tree, and the other two without 5101115. Of these last, one,
which l have already mentioned, 15 common in all the hills 01
India south from the Ganges, and is what Dr. Roxburgh (Hor-t.
Beng. 73.) calls Plzoeniae farinifera; and I think that this is
probably the Hm Inde? of the Ceylonese, and the. Palma dacty-
lifera minor humilis sylvestris fructu minore of Parkinson, Pluke-
net, and Burman. In the North of India this is called Dalmat,-
and its leaves, which are not so rigid as those of the other spe-
cies, are bruised and twisted into ropes. Its fruit is supported
on a stem almost as long as the leaves (frondes).

The other dwarf lemzlz· is found in the more elevated plains
011 1110 north side of the Ganges, where the soil contains much
clay, and in the dialect of Bengal is called Janggali Kleajm·;
and it is, I presume, what Dr. Roxburgh (Hort. Beng. 73.) calls
Plzoenioe acazclis. Either the Plzcrnioe acaulis or P.fhrinifera, there
can be little doubt, is the same with the ansilla of Gaertner
(De Sem. i. 24. t. 9.). The plant found on the north side of the
Ganges is the smallest, and therefore the most suitable for the
name pusilla; but then Gacrtner procured the seeds from Cey-
lon, where it is probable that the plant of Southern India is

alone known. He describes, however, only the fruit; and from
that
