which it is designed to break. In speaking of the shortness os
this member, we measure the space between the rictas and the
apex, which in the birds to which we allude seldom equals the
distance between the mentum and the same point. On the
other hand, the remaining three subdivisions of the family have
a longer, and consequently a, weaker bill. The under mandible
in particular becomes conspicuously elongated, the tomia or
cutting edges being sometimes nearly straight, and the depth
not equalling half the length. The bill thus assumes the gene-
ral form which is found among birds, and (leviatos from that
which appears peculiar* to this family. In some of these longer-
billed birds, which we are thus inclined to consider aberrant
among the Parrots‚ we shall have occasion to observe a devia-
tion also from the mode of feeding prevalent in the family by
the tongue partially superseding the use of the bill. Here we
may trace the first approach to the Picidoe, Certlziaclce, and the
honey-feeding Tenuirostrcs; birds which form a conterminous
group immediately succeeding the present family of Psittacidae,
and of which the use of the tongue is the predominant cha-
racter.

According to these views we shall consider the shorter- and

’⁴⁶‘ W'e know no other bird ’111 which this peculiar construction is found, except the
Γναῖον-(υἷα Arctica, Briss.‚ in which species the depth of the bill from the sront to the
nmmum is nearly equal to the length from the rictus to the apex. This :mahagical rc-
semblance has given that bird the familiar name of Sea-Parvos. In some os the
Lmiada: also we sec an approach to the same depth and shortness of bill, but not an
equal developement of the character. And here also the name of Psittarostra, attached
to one of the groups, indicates the same analogy. We may observe, that the food of the
birds of this latter family is similar to that of the Puri-ors, and requires corresponding
powers of bill. then we spcak os the height of the bills among birds, we do not take
into account those eminences which surmount the bills of some of the Buceritla,
These give an apparent rather than a real elevatior] to these members, and ’111 no wiss-
