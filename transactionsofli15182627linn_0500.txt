450 [Ην. BLAc 1< WA LL’s Observations to ascet-lain

sition to facts, will be rendered evident by the following· obserr
vations and experiments, from which a satisfactory solution ot'
the difficulty, it is hoped, will be obtained.

That gossamer⁷ which usually abounds most in the months of
September and October, is perceived to ascend into the atmo—
sphere only in serene bright. weather, is, l believe, generally
allowed: it is also admitted, that gossamer in the air is invari-
ably preceded by gossamer 011 the ground. These, as will appear
in the sequel, are circumstances of much importance in the pre-
sent investigation; every method ot' accounting for the ascent
os the webs and spiders, however plausible, which does not im-
ply their concurrence, being necessarily erroneous,

But to proceed to my own researches :—A little before noon
on the lst os October 1896, which was a remarkably calm sunny
day, the thermometer in the shade ranging from 55⁰5 to 640, I
observed that the fields and hedges in the neighbourhood of
lNlanehester were covered over, by the united labours of an im-
mense multitude of spiders, with a profusion of fine sliining lines,
intersecting one another at every angle, and forming a confused
kind of net-work. So extremely numerous were these slender
filamentS, that in walking across a small pasture my feet and
ankles were thickly coated with them: it was evident, however,
notwithstanding their great abundance, that they must have been
produced in a very short space of time, as early in the morning
they were not sufficiently conspicuous to attract my notice ; and
011 the soth of September they could not have existed at all ; for
011 referring to my meteorological journaL I find that a strong
gale from the south prevailed during the greater part of that
day.

A circumstance so extraordinary could not fail to excite
curiosity3 but what more particularly arrested my attention
was the ascent of an amazing quantity of webs of an irregular

complicated
