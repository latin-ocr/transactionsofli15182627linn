under the name of Peintmle Cot-nal, but does not mention the
anatomical structure.

Dr. Parsons has given a representation of the trachea of the
Demoiselle (Ardea Virgo of Linnaeus) in the 5o'th volume of the
Plzz'losopleical Transactions, from which Dr. Latham copied 1115
figure ε but as the true character of this trachea is less perfectly
understood by a detached figure, and as this figure nioreover is
somewhat incorrect in the form of the bronchia, I have ventured
to add a drawing of the sternum of this bird with its trachea in
sila, the better to compare it with the structure of the same part
in the very rare bird that will follow. In the present instance,
the trachea, (1111111118ἱ 1119 neck passes downward between the
branches of the furcula toward the anterior edge of the keel,
which is hollowed out to receive it ; into this groove, formed by
the separation of the sides of the keel, the trachea. passes, and is
tirmly bound therein by 9911111111111911111111119. In the figure an-
nexed, a small portion of one edge of the keel is removed, 10
show the depth of the insertion. The usual form of furcula
does not prevail in this bird : it 15 not here, as in most others, a
detached bone, but has the point of 11111011 of the two branches
firinly ossified to the keel, or may be considered 115 11 prolonga-
11011 of the keel itself‚ extended to the head of 911911 9111111919, and
aii‘ording 11 firm support 10 1119 wing. The peculiar formation of
the trachea, and its insertion within the keel of the sternam in
this bird, may be considered as exhibiting the commencement of
that structure, which, with some inoditication in a second spe-
9195, 15 carried to its greatest extent in the Cranes.

One example only of the rare bird above mentioned appears

will be found described and tigured by ΜΓ. Vigors in the second
volume of the Zoological Journal, page ⁴234, under the name of
Antlzropo'ides Stanleyamffl. It is fortunate for 59191199, 111111 1119
