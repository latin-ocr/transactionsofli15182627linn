in considerable quantities to the markets at Norwich and Lynn.
They are eaten cold‚ like Lapwing’s eggs, and also used for
culinary purposes; but they are rather of an inferior quality,
and somewhat like Duck’s eggs in flavour. The person who

This species of Gull never lays inore than three eggs the first
ti1ne; but if these are taken, it will lay again. We found many
of the old birds sitting in the middle of June ; most of these had
only one egg· in the nest, but a few of them had two. Their
nest's are made of the tops of reeds and sedge‚ and are very flat
at the top. The eggs vary so much in size, shape, and colour,
that a person not well acquainted with them would suppose some
of them to belong to a different species of bird. Some are
thickly covered with dusky spots, and others are of a light-blue
colour without any spots at all. The young birds leave the nest.
as soon as hatched, and take to the water. W'hen they can fiy
well the old ones depart with them, and disperse themselves on
the sea-coast, where they are found during the autumn and win-
ter. ssy the middle of July they all leave Scouston, and are
not seen there again till the following spring. We were a little
surprised at seeing some of these Gulls alight and sit upon some
low bushy willows which grow on the island. No other than
the Brown-headed Gull breeds at the above mere. A few of
that kind also breed in many of the marshes contiguous to the
sea-coast of Norfolk.
