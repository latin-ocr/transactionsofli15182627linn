1816, we observed a pair of Red-backed Shrikes very busy in
feeding 11 young Cuckoo which was perched on an oak. This
fact confirms Temminck's remark, who says that the Cuckoo will
sometimes lay its 688 111 1116 11651 of the above-mentioned Shrike.
It also contradicts Montagu, who 11556115 111111 “ 1116 Yellow-hanl-

note of the old Cuckoo as late as the last day in July. The note ot'

Genus XXV. Picus.

An old male bird of this species was brought to 115, which was

a boy was robbing its nest from a 11016 111 a tree. The young,
three in number, were completely fledged ; and what is singular,
one of thern weighed more than the old bird. Their plumage
exactly corresponded with that attributed to the Picus medius ot'
English authors. This instance, therefore, 15 11 corroboration of
that mentioned by lNIontagu in proof that these two birds are the
young and old of the same species. We have killed the young
of this species in the aet of making a jari-ing 110156, and 1116
unable to reconcile this fact with the assertion of Montagu, that
