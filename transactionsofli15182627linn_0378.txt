but most entire. For instance, Amyris punctam, A. sumam-ana,
and A. helnaplcylla of Roxburgh. (This last is not to be con-
founded with Aublet’s Icica leeptaplzylla, which is the Amyris
(ambrosiam of XVilldenow.) ln all three the nectary is a large
fleshy receptacle, separated from the receptacle of stamina and
petals by a strangulation or contraction, which leaves an upper
protuberance to uphold the germ, and a lower to receive the
filaments and petals. The mature fructification of two of these
plants has been observed and described. 'l'he seeds have no
osseous covering, but a single tender integument. Their coty-
ledons are simple3 1131 011 1116 contiguous sides, and convex,
conform to the seed, on the outer surface.

Perhaps another division might be proposed for such plants
as have 3 nectary distinctly glandular. For example, Commi-
phora Maclagascariensc's of Jacquin, the same with Roxburgh's
Amgyris Agallodm. Its nectary consists of as many glands as
there are stamina, situated at the insertion of these. But the
fruit of this species has not been yet inspected, nor even the
hermaphrodite flower. Roxburgh, as well as Jacquin, was
unable to find any besides male flowers.

It does not, however, appear in other instances, where the
complete fructification has been examined, that those differences
in the nectary precisely correspond with primary differenees
observable in the mature fructification, on which, as I appre-
hend, reliance is· to be ultimately placed for a main ground of
generic distinction. Yet it is material to attend to the nectaria]
character in this group of plants. If the staminiferous disk be
connected, as in my view it is, with the germ rather than with
the calyx, it determines the hypogynous insertion of the sta-
mina ; and conscquently shows the necessity of disjoining these
plants srom the perigynous order of Terebintlzaceae, with which
they have been associated. ln this remark I rely on the maxim,

that
