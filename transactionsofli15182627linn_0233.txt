serve, that the only specimen of the G. Pupuensis in the Linnean
collection, collected by Mr. Caley, is marked by that gentleman
as a male; while a specimen of the G. mcluuops is noted as a
female. 'l'ime will clear away the difficulties that attend such
points. At present we can only state the doubts which exist on
the subject.

The bird described above exhibits so many points of distinc-
tion from the preceding specieS, that we have ranked it as sepa-
rate. Its locality also, which is different from that of the other
specieS, serves to strengthen us in this opinion. The chief dif-
ference consists in the inferior size of our bird, all the specimens
we have seen of the former Species being about thirteen inches
in length ; in the darkness of the asli-colour on the back ; in the
narrowness of the frontal band, and particularly in the white
colour of the mentum. There is, however, much variation, as is
alleged, in the Graue. melcmops and Papuensis; and it may hap-
pen that our bird is but the young of one of those species—Oui·
specimen was found on the South Coast by Mr. Brown in 1803.
