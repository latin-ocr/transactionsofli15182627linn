and graduated tail, which gives a striking character to the typi-
cal species of sssalzcrus, is wanting in the present group, in which
the tail is short and rounded ; in some species, indeed, inclining
to become even. Both groups have a bill which partakes of the
character of that of the Muscicapiclce‚ and which has caused some
species among them to be referred to that family. But the bill
of our group is rather more depressed at the base, is shorter and
less arcuated than that of Mulurus. In all these points, how-
ever, the two groups approach each other so nearly in some of
the extreme specieS, that it is difficult to (lraw the line of distinc-
tion between them. As in all similar cases of groups thus ap-
proximating to each other, we fix our attention on the typical
species chiefly of each, which in the present instance may be
considered to be Malus-ns Lambertz? and Acanthiza pusilla.

In reference to the European groups of this family, these two
forms of the New Holland Warblers appear to approach them
more nearly than any other extra-European species The wings
are formed upon the same model, the first quill-feather being
short, although not so much so as in the typical species of
Europe. The integrity of the tarsi, however, the uneven tail,
and the rictus of the bill partially beset with bristles, and ap-
proximating to that of the Flycatclzers, sufficiently point out a
distinction. Of all the European Sylviaclcr, they resemble most
nearly the group of Regulus, Cuv.: they want, however, the
singular plume which covers the nostrils of that genus. The
species which we have met with possess a general similarity in
the disposition of their colours; and they appear to be distin-
guished by the character of having the webs of their feathers,
particularly about the head and neck, more than usually loose
and decomposed. Like the Regali they appear to be the in-
habitants of bushes and low scrubs.
