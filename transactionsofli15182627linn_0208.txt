192 Mr.V1oons's and Dr. HORSFIELD'S Description oftlze

“ The earliest* period of the year that I noticed the appear-
ance of »S'zaaallows was on the ls-'th of J uly 1803, when I saw two :
but Ι remarked several towards the end of the same month in
the following year (1804). The latest period I observed them
was on the soth of May 1806, when a number of them were
twittering and flying high in the air.—W⁷l‘1en I have missed them
at Paramatta, I have sometimes met with them among the north
rocks, a romantio spot about two miles to the northward of the
former place.''

“The natives call the Swullow, Berrin'nin; they told me it
built its nest in the hollow limbs of white gum-trees, using
bark, grass, hair, or similar substances: but when it built in
old houses it made use of mud. These old houses are the
deserted huts of settlers, who have abandoned their worn-out
far1ns; and the nests are constructed on the wall-plates, as
they are called in the colony. Of the nests which have been
brought to me, I have observed that the outside was made os
mud and the inside lined with feathers. Though I have seen
Swallozms more or less almost throughout the year, yet it is my
belief that they are migratory.—The eyes are black.’'

⁴* We must bear in mind, that Mr. Caley’s observations as to the earliness or late-
0055 of the year have a reference to the year of New Holland.
