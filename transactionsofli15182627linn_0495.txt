aids, surrounded by a great variety of novel plants requiring
immediate examination, not long aster my arrival at Rangoon,
and on the very eve of departing on a distant journey to Ava.
I believe I have not omitted any thing that is of importance ; but
in case I have, the accompanying rough sketches of the Hower
may perhaps serve to supply what is wanting in that respect.

The plant grows in great abundance towards the margins of
tantm it is smooth and slender‚ not slimy·‚ the root fixed to
the bott0m3 the leaves at first submersed, afterwards floating,
exceedingly thin, oblong‚ cordate, without the slightest ten-
dency to become peltate. I should have observed, that some-
times, though exceedingly rarely‚ a leaf is to be seen having one
or both margins marked with one 01· two obtuse short lobes, but
this circumstance must be viewed in the light of a monstrosity.
Tho flowers are without any beauty3 but this defect is amply
made up by their very singular structure, widely differing from
that of Nelumw, Nymplzaeu, Euryale, and Nuplzam that is, from
any of the members of the order, to which it unquestionably
belongs. From Podopltylleae, DeCand. the plant is as remote as
any of those genera. 'l'he fiowers are fleshy, smooth and green :
the calyx on the outside purplish-green ; the raised part within
it stained with pink; the rest of a shining sap-green colour
without, and deep-red (atro-sanguineous) on the inside.

The above was written yesterday.—To my great delight, a
berry which I had placed on my table the night before has
ripened fully, and by taking it into my hand it spontaneously
separated into two or three pieces along the dissepiments. Each
cell is easily separable, consisting of a soft mealy fleshy paren-
chyma, pinkisl1-white; the outer margin coated with a thin
membrane (which forms the outside of the berry); the inner
margin (that which looked toward the axis) oblique above and
straight underneath; sides with obliquely-ascending furrows.
