Mr. YAn REL 12 on the Tracheae ofBircls. 385

The different. species of Geese considered British, present
nothing remarkable in their tracheae, the Egyptian Goose alone
excepted. The male of this bird possesses a bony enlargement
at the bottom of its windpipe, in size equal to that marked (a) in
TAB. XV. Systematic authors seem to agree in placing this
bird at the bottom of the list of the Geese, where it appears to
occupy its proper situation.

Combining as it does some of the characters connnon to those
birds and the true Ducks, it becomes a very natural link between
the1n; and with a few observations on an arrangement of the
British species of the latter portion of this family, founded upon
internal as well as external conformation, I shall close this
paper.

The first division of true Ducks will contain the Shielduck,
quscovy, Wild Duck, Gadwall, Shoveler, Pintail, W'igeon,
Bimaculated Druck, Garganey, and TeaL—all of which will be
found 10 have the following characters in common. Externally
they exhibit considerable length of neck: the wings are also
long, reaching to the end of the tail ς 1110 tarsi somewhat round ;
1110 hind-toe free, or having no pendent lobe. In habits they
may be stated generally as frequenting fresh-water, but passing
much of their time on land, feeding in ditches and about the
shallow edges of pools on aquatic plants, 11150015, worms, and
occasionally fish, taking their food at or near the surface; pos-
sessing great powers of ssight, but seldonl diving, unless pur-
sued. Of their internal soft parts, the stomach is 111 1110 greatest
degree muscular, forming a true gizzard ; the intestines long, the
caecal appendages from six to nine inches in length in the larger
birds, and decreasing only in proportion to the 51Ζο of the spe-
cies. Of the bones it may be observed, that the ribs are short,
extending but little beyond the line of the posterior edge of the

sternum; 1110 keel of the breast—bone deep, affording great ex-
