evinces in its author a more extensive and accurate acquaint-
ance with the birds of Eurole, than any other that has been
hitherto published.

Genus I. FALco.
1. F. Islandicus (Jerfalcon).

Several years since, a beautiful specimen of the Jerfalcon was
shot on Bungay common ; and being only slightly wounded in
the pinion, it lived for some time in the possession of John
Cooper, Esq. of that place.

Ω, F. peregrinus (Peregrine Falcon).

Mr. 1on, of lligham in Suffolk‚ trapped two of these birds,
and has seen others at that place. He catches them by fastening
baited steel trapS‚ covered with moss, on the top of a high tree„
upon which he has observed them to be fond of perching.

The Peregrine Falcon visits the warren at Beechamwelh on
the estate of John Motteux, Esq.‚ in autumn, and continues
there during the winter. A pair of these birds bred many years
successively in the cliffs at Hunstanton in Norfolk, though con-
stantly deprived of their young, which were taken and trained
to falconry by Mr. Downes of Gunton; but during the. three
last years they have. ceased to build there.

3. F. Subbutco (Hobby).
4. F. AElsalon (Merlin).

5. F. Timmncnlus (Kestril, Wind-hover, Hover Ilawk).

The stomach of a Kestril killed late in the year was filled with
grubs.

The Rev. Joseph Harrison has employed with success the fol-
lowing method of taking the Kestril.—-A white napkin was
