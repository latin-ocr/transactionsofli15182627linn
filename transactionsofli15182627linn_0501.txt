complicated structure, resembling ravelled silk of the finest qua-
lity and clearest white. They were of various shapes and di—
mensions, some of the largest measuring upward of a yard 111
length, and several inches in breadth in the widest part; while
others were almost as broad as long, presenting an area of a few
square inches only.

These webs, it was quicldy perceived, were not formed in the
air, as is generally believed, but at the earth’s surface. ’1116

by the 1116611111116111 action of gentle airs, adhered together, till by
continual additions they were accumulated into flakes or masses
of considerable magnitude, on which the ascending current,
occasioned by the rarefaction of the air contiguous to the heated
ground, acted with so much force as to separate them from the
objects to which they were attached, raising them in the atmo—
sphere to a perpendicular height of at least several hundred
feet. I collected a number of these webs about mid-day as they
rose, and again in the afternoon, when the upward current had
ceased and they were falling, but scarcely one in twenty con-
tained a spider; though on minute inspection l found small
winged 11156615, chiefly aphides, entangled in most of them.

From contemplating this unusual display of gossamer, my
thoughts were naturally directed to the animals which produced
it; and the countless myriads 111 which they swarmed almost
created as much surprise as the singular occupation that en-
grossed them. Apparently actuated by the same impulse, all
were intent upon traversing the regions of air; accordingly,
after gaining the summits of various objects, as blades of grass,
stubble, raiIS, gateS, &c., by the slow and laborious process of
climbing, they raised themselves still higher by straightening
their limbs 3 and elevatin g the abdomen, by bringing it from the
