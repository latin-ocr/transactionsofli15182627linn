occupies it, and so deep as to elnbrace more than two-thirds
of the bulk of its animal inhabitant. They are large enough
to admit of the animal rising in them a little, but not of its
coming out easily: and their depth is in several considerably
increased by the deposition, around their upper circumference‚
of 11 species of 60111111116 several lines in thickness, and by a
thiu layer of which they 1116 frequently lined throughout. In
common with all the other species, the Echini inhabiting these
cells have their mouths invariably downwards ; and they adhere
by their numerous suckers so firmly to the lodgements they have
formed, as to be forced, with extreme difficulty, from them
when alive.

“ The coast of the county of Clare‚'' Mr. Humphreys informs
me, ‘⁴ at Milltown Malbay, and indeed from the mouth of the
Shannon northward to the isles of Arran, is without a harbour‚
and, except a few bays of fme sand, presents to the eye the most
majestic cliffs. therever the rocks project into the sea, so as
to form ledges accessible at low water, protected in front by
higher rocks, and which are never left entirely dry, these ledges
are perforated by the Echinm and I have seen thousands of
them lying in these cavities side by side. The largest which Ι
saw thus imbedded were about three inches in diameter3 and
the few that I perceived out of their nidi were dead. All that I
thus observed were of the same species. The fishermen 501116-
times take the common Echinus 111 111611 10115161-11015, but these
are never lodged in the rock. I have been lately informed that
they lodge in a similar manner 111 1116 rocks about Berehaven
and Bantry in 1116 west of our county <Cork)‚ and Ι shall endea-
vour to obtain further information respecting their habits from
thence.'’
