Genus XLI. HAEMATOPUS.
l. H. Ostralegas (Oyster-catcher).

The northern shore of Norfolk is a favourite breeding-place ot
this species. The Oyster-catcher is an expert diver ; one which
had its wing broken was with difficulty caught by a good water
(1094.

Genus XLII. CHARADRIUS.

1. C. Pluvialis (Golden Plover).

Golden Plovers make their appearance in this partos the
kingdom in the spring, on their passage to the North, and again
on their return towards the end of the year, at which season they
are sometimes seen in large flocks ; and they have been killed as
late as the end of December. It is probable that they may
occasionally breed in Norfolk, as a few of these birds were seen
last year during the breeding season on Mousehold—heath near

Norwich.

2. C. morinellus (Dottrel).

Both in spring and autumn the Dottrel has been met with in
Norfolk. A considerable number of them were seen in May
1816 in the parts westward of Burnham. We have also noticed

them on Martlesham-heath‚ Suffolk.

3. C. Hiaticula (Ringed Plover).
lNsIr. Scales informs us that the Ringed Plover breeds on the
warren at Beeehamwell: this place is many miles distant from

the sea. And in Mr. Sabine's museum there are specimens of
this species of Plover which were killed at Elston near Thetford.
