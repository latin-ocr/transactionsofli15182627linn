244 Mr. Vmons's ancl Dr. HousFIELD’s Description ofilio

markiugs, we must observe, are important: similar differences
form the points of distinction between our European species,
M. collaris, Bechst„ and M. alricapilla, Linn. {ut at present. we
have not sufficient grounds for decision on this subject: the few
specimens we have in this country exhibiting much appearance
of variation. We therefore merely express our doubts.

We. have necessarily adopted Gmelin’s name for this spe-
cies instead of Dr. Lathmn’s, 111 as much as the former has
the right of priority. Dr. Latham, although he described and
figured the bird in 1783, did not give it a scientific name
until he published his “ Index Ornitlzologicns'' in 1790, two
years after the publication of Gmelin’s “Sys-lema? A line
of distinction must be drawn by which we can invariably de-
termine the choice of names, where a species or a group has
more than one; and the date os publication seems to be the
justest and most uniform by which we can be regulated. 111 the
present instance, however, and in many others of a similar de-
scription, we have to regret, that whatever credit is dra· to him

studies in nature. The law, however, ought to be intlexible:
and as such it would be expedient for naturalists not to exhibit
the fruit of their labours without at the same time characterizing
and naming them.
