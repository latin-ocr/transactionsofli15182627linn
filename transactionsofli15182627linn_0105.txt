on the Hortus Illalabaricus, Part III. 93

they may be covered hyan acid cortex (⁶⁶ sapor in cortice acidus,'’
H. M.); but in the Kadamlm, which I takc to be the Arbor Noctis,
there is not. a vestige of capsulcs, and the fruit is composed of
berries of 11 soft substance throughout. [nfortunately Ι have not
seen the fruit os the Kmlumlm, which Ι think nearest allied to
the Kalon Tsjalca, and therefore I cannot say whether, like the
Arbor Noctis, it. is coniposed of berries, or whether, like the
Kalon Tsjalca, it is coniposed of capsnlae corticulse. There is
0116 circumstance, however, which induces me to suppose that
this Kadamba is not the Kalon 'J'sjalsw This in the figure of the
Hortus Ellalabaricus is represented with the stylus no longer than
the tube of the corolla; but in our Kadamba it is longer than
the laciniae. Although it has a similar stylus, it is quite diffe-
rent from the Cepltalantlms chimensis (Eric. Melle. Sap. iv. 63),
which has violet-coloured flowers, a truncated calyx, and the
stamina included within the tube of the corolla. 'l'hese diffe-
rences between the Kadamba and Katoec Tllffjalca, however, are
minute: nor do I know that they are constant, even in the sanie
individual at different periods of growth 2 and therefore I must
leave the matter to be finally deterinined by those who have
leisure to examine the plants in all their stages when culti-
vated. Should the fruit of both Kadambas be similar, I should
have no doubt that they are mere varicties ; that both should be
referred to the Nauclea Cadamlm of Roxburgh, and to the sanie
genus with the Arbor Noctis of Rumphius, which I call Cadamba
noc-lurum and that they are both different from the Kalon Tsjalca,
which is a real Nauclea or Ceplmlcmtlzus, for these genera are
essentially the same. In the mean time I shall give an account
of this Kacluuzhu, which is most like the Kalon Tsjalm, premising
that Ι 11111 uncertain whether it be this or the other plant of the
sanie name that Dr. Roxburgh called Nazcclea Cadamba. Spe—

ciniens of the plant which I mean, are to be found in the collec-
