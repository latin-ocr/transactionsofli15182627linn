358 Mr. COLEBROOKE on Boszcellia

pulpy, going to pieces when dry, but not opening by deter-
minate valves : they contain, in one or more cells, solitary
seeds3 or, if all the ovulcs ripen, two, or possibly sometimes
three in each cell. In fact, throughout this family the fruit is a
berry, in which the natural number of cells, containing two, or
sometimes three ovules, agrees with that of the petals and caly-
cine (livisions(sep(1la)‚ and corresponds to twice as many stamina.
Exceptions are to be admitted, if the plants have been rightly
(·lassed and described3 101 Α. acuminata and Α. ,ςὶηιμῖίσζίὸίἱα of
Hoxburgh, in which the. germ exhibits but two cells, and A. Ζεμ-
Ianicu 01 Retzius, in which osseous 500115 001110500 and present a
trilocular nut. But all three should perhaps, on account of
these deviations from the natural structure, be removed from
their present place to other genera.

The staminiferous ring around 1110 801111, which was assumed
for a distinctive mark 01 1110 111οα as a separate genus, is not
inore characteristic according to Willdenowffi: for it is found,
more or less c011spicuouS‚ in divers species 011111111115, as it like-
wise is in those of Ram-scra .· and the insertion 01 stamina, as well
115 petals, 111 11, 15 1111 important character pervading the whole
lamily.

In truth, as 10118 1180 10111111110111, 1110 three genera Amyn-is,
Icica, and But-sera, require 10 be thrown together and :re-cast.
The whole group comprises nearly forty species, including seve-
ral yet unpublished ς and is likely to receive further accessions.
It may be expected to become 111111101111γ for a single genus ; 111111
11 actually comprehends plants which do not assort well together.
lt should therefore be subdivided, and moulded anew into distinct
genera. But for this purpose much the greater part of the spe-
cies requires re·examination‚ with a view to the distribution of
thern by truly discriminative marks.
