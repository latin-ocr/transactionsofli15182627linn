foliis, plane similia sunt,’' we may infer that its leaves have a
strong resemblance to those of the Cocos nucifera, which by way
of eminence Rheede calls Palma indica. On these ι0101111113 Ι
think it probable that it may be the §ipa fruticans (umal. Sp.
Pl. iv. 597.). Ι did not indeed observe this in Μ111111)111·; but it
is common near the mouths of the Ganges, and on the banks
of estuaries in the countries and islands south and east from
thence.

The plant here described is perfectly known to 1116, although
in Malabar the natives call it Indu (Journey to Mymre, ii. 469.);
nor did I there hear of the names Toddu, ΔΠοιηα, 01· findam
BIotlza Panna, which Rheede had received at Cochin. He fell
into a great error in considering this as the Soteetsou of the Ja-
panese‚ that is, as the tree which produces sago, as 13 very pro-
perly pointed out by Commeline 111 1113 11016 (p. 14.). Notwith-
standing this, Plukenet (Δίνη. 276.) joins the Toddci Panna with
the Palma fhring'fera Japom'ca of Breynius, or Soteetsou of the
J apanese, an error followed by Linnaeus (Fi. zeyl. 393), when
he established a new genus called Cycas. Concerning these
errors, however, I have said every thing necessary in my Com-
mentary on the first part of the Herbarimn Amboinense, and I
need here only insert the real synonyma of the Toclcla Panna.
