called ‘⁶ Bromls'· in Norfolk, and on some of them in conside-2
rable numbers. In autumn and winter these birds make their
appearance on the rivers in vast flocks: and upon an appointed
day all the boats and guns are put in requisition, and a general
attack is made upon them. On the banks of the Stour the fow-
lers approach them, while sitting upon the ooze, by concealing
themselves behind a skreen made of bushes, which is placed
upon a sledge and driven before them. There is a difficulty
in plucking these birds clean, it being almost impossible to get
the down off by that process. The method therefore used is, to
pluck off the feathers as clean as possible, then to dredge pow-
dered resin over the bird, and to plunge it into hot water; after
which the down will come off quite clean, and the Lird appear
perfectly white and nice—On crossing the Stour in the month
of January 1819, in a dead calm, we observed the Coots fioating
upon the water in a semicircle. On our approach within about
200 yards, the whole body, amounting at the least calculation to
several thousands, partly rose and flapped along the surface of
the water, making a tremendous rushing noise. llad there been
any wind, they would have risen into the air without difficulty ;
but there being none, they could scarcely disentangle their feet.
We killed two wounded birds: one of them afforded excellent
sport, not suffering the boat to approach it without diving,
and coming up oftentimes a hundred yards off: it had the action
and alertness of a Dobchick. Foxes frequent the banks of the
Stour very early in the morning to catch the wounded birds,
which generally make to land, and of which there are sometimes
great numbers. The larger kinds of (J'ulls often attack and
devour Coots. We have observed the latter, on the approach
of their enemy, rush together from all quartem, and form a close,
round, compact body, appearing like bees in the act of swarm-
ing. The Gull kept hovering over their heads, and frequently
