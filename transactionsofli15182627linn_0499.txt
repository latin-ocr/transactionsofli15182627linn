Anrnouc, 11 it is well known that spiders sometimes ascend into
the atmosphere through the instrumentality of fine lines of a
viscous gummy matter, which proceed from the papillae situated
at the extremity of the abdomen, yet the manner in which these
a'erial journeys are effected still remains involved in obscurity,
and considerable diversity of opinion exis-ts as to the particular
species of spider by which they are undertaken. This deficiency
leaves open a wide field for speculati0n3 and accordineg we
find, that natural historialis have ascribed this interesting occur-

evaporation, and electricity; the exercise of peculiar physical

supposed to be endowed3 and the extreme levity of the webs of
these insects, which are represented by some writers on the sub—
