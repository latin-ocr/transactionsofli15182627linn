We have been led into a more detailed description of this
bird than we usually give to an already described species, in
order to point out the differences of its characters from those of
our European Hir. rustica, with which it has been generally
confounded. The chief distinction is in its inferior size; in the
side-feathers of the tail being shorter, and at the same time less
gracile ; in the frontal band being wider, and in the ferrugineus
colour extending over the breast, in place of the broad black
band which characterizes the European species. Our New Hol-
land specimens accord accurately with the figures and descrip-
tions of this species given by MM. Sparmann and Temminck
from Javanese speciinens. The migratory habits of these birds
account for their wide dispersion.

In Mr. Caley's MSS. we find the following observations on
these birds. ‘⁶ The resting-places of these Swallozes are on the
dead boughs of large trees, where I have seen several of them
gathered together, in the same manner as European *S'zwallozcns9 on
the roof of a house. Ι apprehend, however, that it is when their

young have taken to fiight that this occurs.'’ H
