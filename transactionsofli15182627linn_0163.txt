the Persam, giving it the generic name l'odozc, 110 doubt derived
froin the Sanscrita l'ata,· but 111 11115 they have been guided by
the form of the leaves. .

’1119 younger Burman (Fl. [ml. 927.) took up this plant by the
name Ty'alscl11‚ joining to it 1119 Ficus *S'zwattcnsis et qllalabarica,
310275f0li0 of Garcin: but after this 1119 plant seems 10 have
been unnoticed until ΜΓ. Aiton published the first edition of
the Hortus Kezcrnsis, when he called it Picus venosa. NVilldenow
afterwards, in the Berlin¹ Transactions, published an. account of a
tree which he took 10 119 that of the Ilotltus Ix'ezeemiffl but when'
119 publishcd 1119 Species Plantarum (iv, iisd), he discovered
that he had been mistaken. In place, however, of leaving the
name venosa with the plant, which had been originally so called
by Aiton, he transferred it 10 1115 new plant, and the Tsjalaela he
called Ficus itgfcctoria, a word probably of 1115 own coining, but
meant perhaps to i1nply 115 being a dye. This name, however,
has been adopted in 1119 second edition of the Hortus Komensis
(v. 485), and by Dr. Roxburgh (Hm-t. Beng. (jo'.) ; but rejected
by M. Poiret (Eue. Metlz. Sul). ii. (557), who calls the ficus
venosa of Willdenow the F. leuc-anlatomus—rather a. hard name.
Speciniens of the Tsjalcela‚ under the name given by Winenow,
have been presented to the library at the India House: but I
must observe that the specitic character of the Fica-s injkctoria,
given by Willdenow and copied by Λί1011, 15 1101 applicable 10
1119 plant which Ι mean ; and that Ι judge it only 10 be the same,
from the 'l'sjalcela being quoted as synonymous. I shall there-
fore describe it.
