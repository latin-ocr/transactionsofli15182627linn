Genus XIX. ΡΛ nus.

1. P. 1111110)- (Great Titmouse).

This speeies has an astonishing variety of notes. When dis—
turbed 011 115 nest it will make 11 hissing noise, and boon] with its
wings like the Blue Titmouse. W'e have seen such 11 number ofthe.
Great Titinouse 111 a large plantation of evergreens 111 Canipsey
Ash, that the place resounded with the 110150 of their beaks rap-
ping against the bark of the yew-trees. The large hind toe and
crooked claw ofthis kind, and of others of the genus, are doubt-
less of service in enabling these birds to hang in a variety of
attitudes while searching for their food.

12. P. ater (Colemouse).

3. P. ccrrzdezes (Blue Titmouse, 'Betty Tit and Jenny Tit).

In winter the Blue Titmouse frequents the sheds in which tur-
nips are kept, for the sake of feeding on the inaggots which 1110
frequently found in that root, and manv of which are exposed
when the tops of the turnips are eut off previous to their being
given to the cattle.

4. P. palustris (Marsh Titmouse).

5. Ρ. caudatus (Long-tailed Titmouse, Pudding-poke, Capon
Lon g-tail) .

In this part of the kingdom the Long-tailed Titinouse is known

by the name of Pudding-poke, without doubt from the circum-

stance of its building its nest in the form of that household arti-

cle. We have more 1111111 once this spring observed an old bird

of this species sitting in its 11051, with its head partly out of the
hole
