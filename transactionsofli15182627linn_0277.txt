“This bird‚’' says Mr. Caley, “ is called by the colonists
Hit-cine Magpic. It is very good eating, except the hindei·
parts, which have a strong goatish smell. It is gregarious. 1
have known large flocks of these birds come occasionally into
the small trees (Gum-wattle) about Government House and
elsewhere, and hop about from tree to tree until driven away
by being fired at. They may also be seen in large fiocks 011
the new-sown wheat, particularly in the depth of winter.”
