134 Dr. FRANcm IIAMlLToN’s Commentary

these suppositions are liable to great objections, as was indeed
noticed by Plukenet (Alm. 144), although in writing that Com-
mentary Ι did not attend suffleiently to what he said, and con-
founded together two of his plants, which, being placed next
each other, I took for onc,—an error which I beg leave now to
correct. Plukenet mentions an affinity between the Katou ΑΙοιι
and his Ficus arbor 4κ1ηισνπέαηα, Arluzti soliis 71071 serrata, fructu
Pisi magnitudine, funiculis c ¹ramis ml terram demissis prolisera
(Plljsf- t. 178.f. 4.), now called Ficus pedunculala (ll‘illcl. Sl). Pl.
iv. 1 138.); but he says expressly, that Commeline erred in con-
sidering the Kalon Alou as the Ficus Indica ,· and that the Kalon
Alma could not be the American plant which he described, because
its fruit is much larger and its leaves hairy beneath; while the
fruit of the American species being like Pease, and its leaves
being smooth, it has a greater affinity to the 'Itsjalsela of Rhcede.
In fact, this American tree is the Ficzcsl11111·{s'oli‹1 of M. Lamarck
(Eue. ssIctlz. ii. 495.)‚ and perhaps the Ficus venosa of Willdenow
(Sp. Pl. iv. 1136.); while the Ty'alcela is the Ficus venosa of the
Hortus Keteensis (first edition, iii. 451), now called ficus infec-
tor-la. The I’eralzc, indeed, which I agree with Dr. Roxburgh in
thinking to be the true ficus Indica, Plukenet referred, but with
doubt, to another American plant, his Ficus Americana, latiori
folio cenoso ezr Cal-asoa (A lm. 1443 Plzyt. t. 178.f. 1.), which was
then cultivated in the Royal Garden at Hampton—Court; and
this in all probability is the tree which Lhmaeus, omitting the
cautious doubt of Plukenet, called the Ficus Benglzalensis, the
barbarous name of which I complained. The figure of Plukenet
(I'lzyt. t. 178.f. 1.) has no doubt a considerable resemblance to
the Per-alm but the difference of the countries where they grow
is so great, that much reliance cannot be placed on figures that
represent neither flower nor fruit. The figure, besides, of Plu-
kenet resembles fully as niueh the Katozc ΑΙοιι as the Per-alu,-
