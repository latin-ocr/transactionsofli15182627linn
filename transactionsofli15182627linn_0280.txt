Mr. Caley says that ‘⁶ the male of this species is reckoned a very
scarce bird, and is highly valued. The natives call it Cozctys,
the colonists Satin Bira. I have now and then niet with a
solitary bird of this species: but Ι once saw large fiochs of
then] on some newly-sown wheat, from whence they fied, 011
being scared, into a neighbouring brush: when all was again
quiet, they soon returned to the wheat. 'l'hey did not leave the
brush above a few yards. There were no black ones among
them ; nor can I affirm that they were feeding on the wheat.”

lt is singular that this beautiful and well-known bird should
never have as yet received av specific name. Although it has
been made the type of a genus by M. Kuhl, and published as
such by M. Temminck in his “Mumwl‚'' we no where have met
with a scientific name for the species. We are happy to have
the opportunity of uniting with Dr. Latham in designating so
distinguished a bird by the name of the late respected Secretary
of this Society.
