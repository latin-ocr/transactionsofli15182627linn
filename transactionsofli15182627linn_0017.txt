to attack them if they approach too near: he has, however, a
little of the coward about him, as this is generally done when
their backs are towards him. We saw liis manner of devouring

We have been favoured by Mr. Harrison with the following
observations upon this species—‘⁶ This bird may be taken in a
similar manner to that described for taking the KestriL——by
limed twigs and a sparrow. His disposition, however, appears
much more shy and fearful of the human species than that of the
other. I made an experiment to tame one last summer. IIe was
brought to me whilst very young, and every possible care was
taken to gain his attachment: but this proved of no avail: he
was fierce, savage and fearful, and without any attachment to
those who fed him. llis wing was cut, to prevent him from
preying upon living birds. When oppressed with hunger he
would come upon my arm, ifl approached him and showed him
either bird, mouse, or flesh of any kind, but would not long
remain unless he had something given him. Ile had a stand in
the garden, where he was regularly fed whilst young: but when
he became capable of fiying to a distance, lie would not remain
there to eat what was placed upon it, unless it was t'astened by
a string or wire; and even then he would leave it on the ap—
pearance of any of the domestics who had been in the habit of
feeding him, or of any animal. When Ι gently approached him
myself, at the same time calling to him, he would sometimes
remain. His favourite abode was in a meadow near the house.
