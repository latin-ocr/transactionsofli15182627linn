muscles z the enlargement at the bottom of the trachea in all of
them is of bone only. The Wild Duck may be considered the
type of this division.

'l'he Eider Duck‚ King Duck, Velvet Duck, and Scoter, pos-
sessing some characters common to the preceding class, and
others belonging to that next in successim, appear to supply the
lini< between these two divisionS. I regret that the extreme
rarity of three of the species last named has hitherto prevented
my obtaining any examination beyond that afforded by the exter-
nal partos preserved specimens in collections; and I am there-
fore unable to state their comparative structure.

The next division of true Ducks includes in the following or-

deep parts of the largest fresh-water lakes, and have been
called oceanic Diicl<s; seldom seen on land; their wall< em—
barrassed from the backward position of the legS‚ but dive
constantly and with great facility, taking their prey at various
depths below the surface; their food tinned and shell-fish‚ ma-
rine insects, but little or no vegetable- productiori ; their powers

the internal cavity increases in size, those of the Long-tailed
Duck and (iolden Eye most resembling the stomach of the
Mergansers; the intestines and caecal appendages are shorter,
