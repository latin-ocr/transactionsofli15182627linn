represented by the Sim-nus carunculatus, Gmel„ the other by the
bird before us. lle places this genus 111 the vicinity of the
Sturnidce; uniting· it with one or two other forms, which are
chiefly distinguished by fleshy proeesses from their hemls, into a
family under the name of Carum-alati. As we consider our
present group to have no relation to the Slurnidae beyond the
unimportant analogical one of having in common with two 01·
three speeies carunculnted append-ages to the head, we have no
hesitatmn in relnoving it from the genus Crannona,- leaving the
Stat-nus curmzculatus (with which species however we must con-
fess that we are unuequainted) to represent that group.
